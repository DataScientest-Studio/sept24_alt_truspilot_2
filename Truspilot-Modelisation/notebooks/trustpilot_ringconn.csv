I talked to customer service a couple of times for clarification- first time the representative made me feel very confident that the answers they gave were correct. Second time a little different experience but not enough to keep me from ordering. My questions were if the actual ring was the same size as the sizing kit or slightly smaller or bigger. Told slightly smaller, when I got the ring it was actually slightly bigger, very slightly. I went with the size that the sizer was slightly difficult to get over my knuckle. Would have preferred a 1/2 size but informed not available, doesn't hurt to ask. Actual ring slides a bit too easy a 1/2 size smaller would have been perfect.

"Great ring overall! Just needs some improvements in monitoring workouts.","This has been a great smart ring! The price is right and I love that the app and plethora of data are both free. The first ring I received was not tracking vitals properly, but RingConn was responsive and sent a replacement ring (it did take a couple of weeks). This ring has been consistently tracking data and I love how many graphs are provided for interpretation. It seems to do a good job with step tracking (at least for trends), but it struggles to accurately monitor my heart rate during rowing workouts. I have automatic workout mode detection on and even set it to an indoor cycling workout, but my heart rate is rarely registers above 110 bpm. It does much better during running workouts.

Women’s health cycle tracking was one of my main reasons for purchasing. It’s very simple, but temperature shifts was all I needed, so this does the job just fine.

"Exceptional Product and Customer Service – A Truly Outstanding Experience","I've been a dedicated supporter of RingConn since December 2022, initially backing them through their Indiegogo campaign. From the very beginning, their communication has been nothing short of excellent—clear, consistent, and timely.

Over time, I've watched the RingConn Android app evolve through multiple updates, each bringing meaningful improvements. The biometric insights provided by the ring have been both valuable and informative, helping me better understand and monitor my health.

When RingConn released Version 2 of their smart ring in September 2024, I didn’t hesitate to place an order. The purchasing experience was seamless, and once again, their communication throughout the process was top-tier.

In April 2025, I reached out to their customer support team with a question. I was blown away—not only does RingConn offer what I believe to be the best smart ring on the market (especially considering its competitive price, lack of a subscription fee, and robust health tracking features), but their customer support is truly outstanding. Their responses were prompt, clear, and reliable. Most impressively, when they say they’ll follow up—they actually do.

It would be nice if it 'talked' to the watch/watch software. Also it needs to come in 1/2 sizes. I've had to add a small piece of mounting tape to the underside of the top to keep it from constantly rolling around my finger. However the next size smaller was nearly impossible to get off my finger if my hand was warm so I sized 1 up.","","2025-05-23T15:36:07.000Z",""

"A sleek ring with great features","I’ve been using the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring for several weeks now, and I am very happy with it. I never expected the ring to be perfect and there is nothing like a visit to your healthcare provider however, with my experience using the RingConn, I am very satisfied with the close to accurate information I get. The information it provides me keeps me on track with my wellness goals. I especially like the sleep feature, which allows me to see my sleeping patterns and how to improve them. The ring provides various features and although I might not utilize them all, I am glad they are available. I did research on the different health rings available in the market and felt that this particular model of ring would best suit my needs.
The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is a compelling choice for those seeking a high quality health monitoring device without the burden of subscription fees. Its exceptional battery life, comfortable design, and health tracking features make it a worthwhile purchase. While I have experienced some limitations in fitness tracking the overall value it offers has far exceeded my expectations.","","2025-05-23T01:21:53.000Z",""
