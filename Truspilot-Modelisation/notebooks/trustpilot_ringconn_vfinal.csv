Inaccurate,After using the RingConn Gen2 for one week I find it to be inaccurate in many aspects particularly step count as compared to both my Apple Watch and iPhone. I also found that the O2 saturation levels were inaccurate as compared to my pulse oximeter. It did not detect nap times either. Although it is an attractive ring I’m questioning its accuracy in other areas as well.,2,2025-06-06T11:36:19.000Z,

It's early but overall very satisfied,"Over all I am very satisfied with the ring. It doesn't have more bells & whistles than necessary. I wish the app was a bit more customizable. I talked to customer service a couple of times for clarification- first time the representative made me feel very confident that the answers they gave were correct. Second time a little different experience but not enough to keep me from ordering. My questions were if the actual ring was the same size as the sizing kit or slightly smaller or bigger. Told slightly smaller, when I got the ring it was actually slightly bigger, very slightly. I went with the size that the sizer was slightly difficult to get over my knuckle. Would have preferred a 1/2 size but informed not available, doesn't hurt to ask. Actual ring slides a bit too easy a 1/2 size smaller would have been perfect.
Look forward using this for a lot longer than I used my Fitbit charge6.",4,2025-06-06T01:57:43.000Z,
Great ring overall! Just needs some improvements in monitoring workouts.,"This has been a great smart ring! The price is right and I love that the app and plethora of data are both free. The first ring I received was not tracking vitals properly, but RingConn was responsive and sent a replacement ring (it did take a couple of weeks). This ring has been consistently tracking data and I love how many graphs are provided for interpretation. It seems to do a good job with step tracking (at least for trends), but it struggles to accurately monitor my heart rate during rowing workouts. I have automatic workout mode detection on and even set it to an indoor cycling workout, but my heart rate is rarely registers above 110 bpm. It does much better during running workouts.

Women’s health cycle tracking was one of my main reasons for purchasing. It’s very simple, but temperature shifts was all I needed, so this does the job just fine.

Overall, I would definitely recommend the ring!",4,2025-06-05T21:53:46.000Z,

Room for accuracy improvement,I think the sleep tracking is accurate along with stress. The heart rate is terrible. i did an intense HIIT cycle workout for 15 minutes where I know it is burning at least 100 calories and my ring said it burned 7... and the my BPM is like 75. So that's frustrating that the calorie burn is not accurate and I can't return it even if I wanted to.,3,2025-06-04T17:12:39.000Z,

I can’t disable Messages from Rincon, That I’m too long in bed and not moving.
But I’m just reading and working.

Accuracy
the heart rate measurement bpm It’s not reacting fast enough while In training mode. It should permanently measure my heart so that I can know when I should slow down.

Exceptional Product and Customer Service – A Truly Outstanding Experience,"I've been a dedicated supporter of RingConn since December 2022, initially backing them through their Indiegogo campaign. From the very beginning, their communication has been nothing short of excellent—clear, consistent, and timely.

Over time, I've watched the RingConn Android app evolve through multiple updates, each bringing meaningful improvements. The biometric insights provided by the ring have been both valuable and informative, helping me better understand and monitor my health.

When RingConn released Version 2 of their smart ring in September 2024, I didn’t hesitate to place an order. The purchasing experience was seamless, and once again, their communication throughout the process was top-tier.

In April 2025, I reached out to their customer support team with a question. I was blown away—not only does RingConn offer what I believe to be the best smart ring on the market (especially considering its competitive price, lack of a subscription fee, and robust health tracking features), but their customer support is truly outstanding. Their responses were prompt, clear, and reliable. Most impressively, when they say they’ll follow up—they actually do.

My experience with both the product and the support team has far exceeded my expectations. I wholeheartedly recommend RingConn to anyone looking for a high-quality smart ring backed by exceptional service.",5,2025-05-24T15:37:36.000Z,

I've had to add a small piece of mounting tape to the underside of the top to keep it from constantly rolling around my finger.

The information it provides me keeps me on track with my wellness goals. I especially like the sleep feature, which allows me to see my sleeping patterns and how to improve them. The ring provides various features and although I might not utilize them all, I am glad they are available. I did research on the different health rings available in the market and felt that this particular model of ring would best suit my needs.
The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is a compelling choice for those seeking a high quality health monitoring device without the burden of subscription fees.

The first 3 days I did their sleep apnea tracking and it worked wonderfully. Very cool to see all of the insights as someone with sleep apnea. I wear it daily to track my heart rate as I have a condition called POTS. This seems to be the only ring that constantly tracks your heart rate even when not exercising. Battery life is amazing.

I've found when I wake up it already has 100+ steps (I don't sleepwalk or get up to go to the bathroom) and I question whether the step count is accurate during the day as well- it always seems very high. And the sleep must be based on being horizontal? I was recently traveling and got some great, long sleep on some plane rides but the ring totally missed it. And then it counted a massage as my being completely asleep. I may have dozed off for a minute or two lol but definitely did not sleep through the whole thing.

Liars and a scam,"My ring was having problems getting correct data readings. I contacted customer service by email because the phone number goes straight to voicemail and they do not call you back.
For 3 weeks, I had a gen 1 ring and after a week of talking they offered me $100 a gen 2 ring, so I picked one the gen 2 air. They came back and said that offer was $50, I told them they didn't specify which one so they can't do that. Days later they email me and tell me they will send it for free. They confirmed my address twice and nothing. So the next email they wanted me to send back the old one first and then they would send the new one. That came out of nowhere and they had never said this before. I advised I was not comfortable with that since all the problems so far. We confirmed my address again and they said they would ship it right away with a return slip for the other one inside. That was a week ago and still nothing, so I have to email again
I also started to screen shot the emails as I noticed they were deleting some where they stated things they promised they were going to do and never did.
This company is a scam, bunch of liars, and all you will get is emails to appease you. If you don't constantly email them sometimes 2 and 3 times a day cause your haven't gotten a response they just send you another email of something else they want you to do that was never part of the discussion.

I never received the ring so this is more a review of ordering and support,"I ordered a stainless steel-colored ring for my wife’s birthday. When the sizing kit arrived, it included not only ring sizers but also color samples. After reviewing them, my wife decided she preferred the rose gold option. I reached out to customer support to change the selection, but they advised me to cancel the original order and place a new one for the rose gold version.

I followed their instructions and placed a new order. However, after a lengthy shipping process, I received a package containing a sleep mask and an aromatherapy kit—no ring. I contacted support again, and while they did investigate with the shipping provider and issued a refund, I was left scrambling to find a replacement birthday gift.

In the end, after more than a month, two orders were charged and refunded, and I received a package of unrelated items. I’m genuinely shocked at how disorganized and unreliable their order fulfillment process has been.",2,2025-05-05T15:44:53.000Z,
Helpful data for wellness goals,"The ring sizer kit showed up fast and was easy to use, the actual ring took a while as it shipped from china. The ring fits perfectly and the data it gives in the app is really helpful. Especially for balancing your wellness. The battery life lasts about 10 days. I tried a cheaper one that didn’t provide as much granular data, and it broke within 6 months- this is a massive upgrade from that, though I’ve only had it for a month, so we’ll see if it continues to work. Overall I’m really happy with it and would recommend it, especially if you find sleeping in your watch/tracker to be awkward.",5,2025-05-05T15:33:13.000Z,

"Not accurate, lots of issues",The ring does not automatically track exercise as it claims. There are also very limited types of exercise you can log and it can’t be done after the fact. It also does not accurately track heart rate during exercise and maxes out around 135bpm. It also then flags elevated heart rate during exercise as an outlier which affects your health score. Step tracking is also not accurate. Basically a glorified sleep tracker and with the other issues not sure I can trust even that. Probably would not have purchased if I’d have known about this issues. I’m hoping that with continued wear it will at least be an accurate menstrual cycle tracker.,2,2025-05-02T19:34:10.000Z,

App is ok, could be better. Doesn’t allow you to edit your notes and the explanation is so vague for some of the reasons your numbers are not within normal ranges. Doesn’t allow you to change your health plan. It just asks you a few questions and sets the plan for you, but doesn’t allow for you to personalize like the apple watch - setting your goals for steps, your activity goal, work out goals, etc.",3,2025-05-02T07:07:16.000Z,
Best Customer Service,"The RingConn Customer Service Team has gone above and beyond to make my experience great. Due to the Canada Post strike, I was delayed getting my sizing kit prior to leaving on a trip, and they were accommodating and understanding of the delay. By the time I had returned, the rose gold colour had been released, and I wished to change my original order. They helped me cancel the old order, place a new one, AND honoured my original discount code.

Love this smart ring!,I looked at all the smart ring options and took a chance last year with RingConn. A newer company with no monthly fee. I have been very happy with the results/ data collected. I lost my ring while traveling so I ordered another of the 2nd generation. Again I am happy with the results. I originally bought it for the sleep data and have been really satisfied with that. When I made a mistake in ordering my ring without the care package they were very accommodating in cancelling my order and then reordering with the care package. I like the longevity of the battery and the notice to charge gives you enough time to do that. Charging the ring is super fast,5,2025-05-01T17:05:16.000Z,
Fantastic Product,"Bought this on a recommendation I saw online, and I'd already been looking for a replacement for my Oura ring. Their subscription model was really syratinh to annoy me.

Worst customer service experience,Worst customer service experience from the start. Contacted them as my Ron g suddenly died less than a year. PAID to get a new ring which took over 2.5 weeks to get.

They let you return it in 14 days or less. It does take a few emails to get return authorization and a small fee to return it. I order a new ring that fits and it works very well.

Not Disability (immobility) friendly ….yet????,"Your ring does not in any way cater for Disabled or Chronically ill people. Which is surprising, when it is said to be medically approved. I’d have thought it would be designed with those people in mind. Alas, I am bed and wheelchair bound, but get asked to get up out of my sedentary position constantly all day long. I find it extremely offensive and frustrating that I can’t turn this off, despite not having the exercise options on. It thinks I’m taking steps when it’s been over a dozen years when I took any. Please, please update this! Even the Apple Watch has a wheelchair user option to recognise if a person does not have the ability to be mobile.

As for the other features. They are great. But.. an alert on your phone/app for extremely abnormal O2 sats or HR would be much more useful than having to look it up after the fact.",3,2025-04-28T09:37:29.000Z,

Love the fit,"Love the fit, the size isn’t too intrusive. It’s much lighter than I thought it would be. Feels cheap, but I like that it’s not heavy because I can’t even tell I have it on. I gave it 3 stars because it doesn’t track any exercises that I do. It only does indoor/outdoor walking/running and cycling. I do weightlifting, volleyball, yoga, boxing…etc. It’s totally my fault for not doing more research. I really like everything else about it. If it tracked more exercises then it would be a 5 star. The cycle tracking and the sleep tracking I like. It might over count my steps though. My Apple Watch always has a couple thousand less steps than the ring. So I don’t really trust that and I go above and beyond my step goal",3,2025-04-28T03:39:34.000Z,

"Theres nothing ""smart"" about it.","Review for Ringconn Gen 2

Overall, really disappointed in this product.
I honestly want to return it. But one, it will cost me to ship it back. and two, I dont have time to deal with that right now.

Its basically a wearable ring health tracker. theres nothing ""smart"" about it.
It only writes data, it doesnt read. meaning that it can only go off its own data.
I wish i did more research and got something with more integration, AI, habits, and insights.
the main reason i chose this ring was for the sleep apnea and O2 tracking, which im not even happy with.

only positive i have is the battery life.

Negatives:
* you can tell from its language that it was manufactured in china.
* iv had issues with the O2 not reading correctly, which is the primary reason i got it.
* I also got it specifically for the sleep apnea tracking, but what i didnt find out till i got it, is that you have to turn on that setting for it to work, its not tracking everyday on its own. also it says that it consumes more battery life as well.
* I get warnings for ""outliers"" in my heart rate and HRV all the time, but its mostly because my schedule varies so much.
* also considers my panic attacks as ""moderate to high - intensity activity / exercise mode"" even when heart rate is unusually high and theres little to no movement.
* i also hate how they have ads on facebook that you can wear it while swimming and in the sauna, but when you read about the ring in the app, it specifically says you shouldnt wear it in the sauna.

Those are all the issues i can think of off hand, but im sure theres more.
Overall, my suggestion is do your research. theres better options than this.",1,2025-04-26T20:30:28.000Z,

Great alternative to smart-watch for biometrics.,"Ringconn
Good product.

The app covers all the biometrics comprehensively. Information is displayed well and has both (i)explanations and (>) break-out boxes with more detail.
Previous daily data is a matter of swiping right (and left to come back). Judging from the calendar drop down this will probably include daily data for as long as you keep it.
Longer term trends are also available from a different tab.

The ring is easy to wear, remarkably lightweight, and looks good. The ring's durability has yet to be fully tested but has survived a fair amount of basic tool use and gardening so far. I don't avoid getting it wet with the exception that I avoid putting it in hot water (dishes, showers etc).

There's always minor issues that may be in development or just personal preferences, nothing at all show stopping though.
(Audience for the following is more for the developers.)
Y-Axis of graphs varies across days making visual comparisons inconclusive.
.. there could be user defined ranges.
.. or ranges could be re-aligned automatically when required.
.. these could be toggled on/off.
X-Axis includes multiple data points per column.
.. a single column contains low,medium,high,vigorous.
.. this could be a minute by minute line showing the fluctuations.
.. again this could be toggled on/off.
Sleep value went down after unusually large amounts of sleep.
.. makes sense, something is wrong... but;
.. app says ""slow down"", so is only looking at final score, not gross value of sleep.
(Also records 'sleep' while I'm screen-reading books)
The Stress indicator appears remarkably inaccurate. I don't know enough to make suggestions but it is an area that would likely benefit from some more research.
Data doesn't update without an internet connection.
.. surely the base calculations are simple enough to process on device. There are times when it quite difficult to obtain internet on a regular basis.
Some of those points would be concessions to battery life, and battery life was a primary consideration of purchase.",5,2025-04-21T00:30:32.000Z,

The Ringconn ring is comfortable to wear and light enough on my finger. I'm given a detailed report every day of my heart functions on my phone. All the information will provide me with what I am concerned with, so I can call my cardiologist and inform them of readings I need an explanation for.

In dim or dark situations it is often difficult for me to tell if the ring is properly positioned.

The included charger is smaller but it doesn't include a battery like the standard model. I guess that's how they reduced the price. Personally I like the smaller charger and I don't mind charging it once a week. I do wish the gold color choice was available for the Air model. Now to the App... it doesn't have all the health metrics that the Apple watch has, but for what it does measure, the ring and watch are in close agreement. The RingConn app is easier to read at a glance and also easier to navigate. Drilling down, the detail is sensibly displayed using easy to understand graphs and charts.

RingConn Gen 2 Review from 🇩🇪,"RingConn Gen 2 Review – A Sleek Alternative to the Smartwatch

I’ve been using the RingConn Gen 2 for about three weeks now, and I have to say—I’m genuinely impressed.

Customer Support That Delivers
My experience started on a positive note even before the ring arrived. I accidentally ordered the wrong size, but after contacting customer support, they quickly and efficiently arranged for the correct size to be shipped instead. The entire process was smooth, and I received the perfectly fitting ring without any issues.

A Small Device with Big Capabilities
What really surprised me was how advanced this little ring is when it comes to tracking health data. It captures a wide range of metrics throughout the day with impressive accuracy. As someone who has used smartwatches in the past, I’d say the RingConn is a compelling alternative—especially for those looking for something more discreet and lightweight.

Whether you're monitoring workouts, sleep, or vital signs, the ring delivers solid insights. That said, during strength training or any activity involving weights, I’d recommend using finger tape to avoid potential scratches.

Comfort & Fit
I’m not someone who normally wears rings, but I quickly got used to this one. It feels natural on the finger and doesn’t shift or feel loose—even during runs or fast, sudden movements. I never once felt like it might fall off.

Final Thoughts & Sizing Tip
The RingConn Gen 2 combines style, comfort, and functionality in a surprisingly compact form. For anyone looking to track their health without the bulk of a smartwatch, this ring is absolutely worth considering.

My recommendation for sizing:
I suggest choosing a comfortable size for your index finger that also fits snugly on your middle finger and slightly looser on your ring finger. This gives you flexibility and ensures the ring stays comfortable throughout the day, no matter which finger you wear it on.",5,2025-04-15T20:39:11.000Z,
A great ring!,"Customer service was quick to respond via email. The ring is great! Battery lasts about 6+ days so far. It is thinner and sleeker than its competitors, which is a major plus for someone with smaller hands. The app is free (no monthly fee) and is insightful and informative.

The return process unfortunately falls short.,The return process unfortunately does not work well for the customer. I had to change ring sizes due to the ring being to loose. I used the sizing kit to choose the correct ring but the actual ring size fit to loosely. I had to ship the old ring back before they would ship the replacement which I had to pay for shipping. Ringconn provided a shipping label which ended up being ground shipping. This meant the ring would not get back to ringconn for 3 to 5 days. Meaning the new ring would not be shipped until received. I will be without the ring for almost two weeks. I consider this poor customer service. As a note sleep data is vastly over stated. The REM and DEEP stats are between three and four hours a night combined. My apple watch and Garmin are both under 2 hours. Based on the return experience and data issues I don't recommend this Ring.

The data and analytics in the app are quite basic, the AI feature and goal plans could be utilized more to make the ring better.

Every time I asked a question, even if it was a follow-up on the same issue, they just copied and pasted the same paragraph. It’s like talking to a bot, not a real person. There’s zero effort to actually help or resolve anything.

After going back and forth for weeks, I still have NO ring, NO refund, and NO clear explanation of what’s going on. It honestly feels like they’re just stalling, hoping I’ll give up. Their process is incredibly frustrating and makes you feel powerless.

Great ring!,"Great ring to monitor sleep, heart rate, stress level and basic daily activities. The battery lasts forever as advertised which was a seller for me. I did a VO2max test at my doctor wearing the ring and the heart rate monitoring was very accurate on the treadmill setting.
It is very light, slim and comfortable. I have the silver one which looks great with my gold wedding ring and mechanical watch.

My wishes:
Add more sports OR A FEATURE to monitor and record your heart rate in real time (to be displayed on a graph after) while you're doing a demanding cardio activity other than the 4 on the app.
Add swimming and a general indoor cardio workout for stationary machines.

Great product!,"Date of experience: March 04, 2025",5,2025-04-01T11:34:43.000Z,
More good than bad,"PROS: (1). Lightweight, attractive, well-built, comfortable to wear (2). User-friendly interface with easily understood and accessible data. GUI not “gimmicky” (3). Sleep apnea evaluation option (4). Fast response from customer service to questions (5). Outstanding battery life with fast recharge.
CONS: (1). Simply not dependable as a step-counting activity tracker. For instance, mowing on a riding lawn tractor for a few hours results in 17,000 steps counted. Per customer service: “certain devices may misinterpret some arm movements as walking, leading to an overestimation. Also, the ring estimates step count based on accelerometer data and other sensor inputs. Therefore, in daily life, certain movements—such as unconscious actions caused by ankle pain or hand movements while sitting—may sometimes be misinterpreted as steps, leading to an overestimation of step count.” So, 17,000 steps counted while seated. No sh*t, Sherlock! (2). Less than useful advice, like “The REM state still has room for improvement” without further recommendations.
OVERALL, while the device provides a wealth of data, much of that data and evaluation seems integrated into questionable accelerometer data, so the balance of the data feels less reliable than I had expected. However, I believe this is a common problem with ring-type trackers, and not unique to RingConn.",4,2025-03-29T02:23:01.000Z,

Loyal Gen1 User - Soon to be Signing Off.,"Ringconn Gen1 user here.

I've been using my Gen1 ring now religiously for around 14months, and the battery has started to last only a few hours - not the 1 week or so that it did when it was new.

I've had a cracking experience with this ring, but its days are now numbered - sadly.

Now, I did message Ringconn on a social media channel, which never got a reply and is basically rubbish service (especially these days - not even an acknowledgement).

To this end, I won't be upgrading to a Gen2 and I'll be going elsewhere for my next wearable ring tech.",3,2025-03-14T22:36:16.000Z,

Ringe size change RingConn Gen 2.,"I had to change my RingConn Gen 2 Mate Black size 13 to size 12 and had a good customer experience with the RingConn support Team in changing the ring size against a little fee. I think the difference to the the size kit is also quite strong related to the swelling in cold and warm weather also the swelling in the night. For example with ring size 12, i can use it in the night an the left indexfinger and in daytime on the right index finger, while with size 13 i can wear in the night at the right index finger, but in daytime i'm losing it from both index fingers. Regarding functionality i'm quite happy, regarding walking steps it seems to overestimate in comparison to my Garmin Fenix 7 watch. I' very happy with sleep recording and sleep apnoe screening.

Buying and using the RingConn2,"Key points: Pros- great service, smooth buying experience and love the product. Sleep tracking is excellent. (For women- cycle tracking aspect is intuitive and un-intrusive)
Cons- only registers running and cycling as exercises, no manual entry for other forms of exercise or times when you can't wear it.

I backed the RingConn2 in its Kickstarter campaign. The whole process was smooth and hassle free. I got my sizing kit fairly quickly, and wore a few different sizes to see what felt right. I found it very difficult to select the right size, but eventually settled on one. When the time came, I selected my colour and size, and sat back and waited for my order to be shipped. Once I got it, I discovered that the fit was not as I expected, but enough larger than the demo sizer to not fit me properly, so I requested a size exchange. This went through without a hitch, and I absolutely LOVE my RingConn2 ring! It tracks my sleep very well (which is the main reason I got it) and all my other bios. The one and only nit that I would pick would be that you can't enter manual exercise entries, and the ring only records running & cycling. This means that the fitness classes that I do where I can't wear the ring don't get recognised as active/activity times. Also, it doesn't register any of the fitness classes I do as exercise, and if it's a low/no impact class that doesn't register any steps but does raise the heartrate, the app registers my exercise as moderate stress.
This is not enough of an issue to impact my satisfaction with the ring and the process of buying it online.
The cycle tracking is fairly basic but pretty easy to use and easy enough to modify if needed. The interface is intuitive and un-intrusive.",5,2025-03-01T14:04:35.000Z,

Great for steps and sleep tracking,"I do enjoy the ring very much. I have the black matte and it looks low profile and nice with my other rings. I feel like the steps are extremely accurate.
I wish it had an exercise to track indoor walks. If I’m walking indoors I just use the running indoors but I’m surprised it’s not an option. I am looking forward to seeing the accuracy of outdoor cycling rides once the weather gets better that’s one of the main reasons I got the ring. My smart watch was just too bulky and wasn’t fitting in with my day to day style. I also enjoy the sleep tracking",5,2025-02-28T14:32:54.000Z,

"Simple, Efficient, Long Lasting Smart Ring in the Market!","Why RingConn? I've tried other smart fit tracker device and smart watches are not for me. I'm personally looking for a smart ring device that is simple, efficient and has long lasting battery. Comparing it with other brands in the market, their technology and ""free app"" integration were the wins for me. Not to mention, its affordable price range. I wanted to use it mainly to keeping track of my heart rates and primarily my sleep. I got the RingConn 2 Silver from their Black Friday sale on their website as an early Christmas gift for myself! It was definitely worth the purchase! Shipping was fast to the Philippines. Make sure first to get their sizing kit to ensure you'll get the perfect and comfortable fit. I've been using it for the past three months and it's pretty much seamless- sometimes I forgot that I'm wearing it. One downside though is the silicone ring protection. It's thin enough for comfort however not that durable as it got essily worn out. Nonetheless, this dmart ring device serves its purpose to let me know how I'm sleeping and a motivation to drive a fit lifestyle. Thank you RingConn Team! More power and I hope the app stays free 🙏",5,2025-02-28T02:47:34.000Z,

Best SmartRing,"I’ve had this ring for two or three months now, and I’ve been wearing it almost every day, and I love it! I found the sizing to be pretty accurate to the kit that they offer. With the gold finish, beware that the palm side of the ring will scratch if you’re using it to work out with dumbbells, etc. However, this is expected and the most visible parts of the ring hold up very well to every day wear and tear. I love the app and how easily accessible everything is, and the battery life of the ring is exceptional! It really does last around 10 days on a full charge. I bought this ring because I didn’t like the sporty look of most smart watches, as I typically have to wear business professional clothing. Both me and my friend whom I recommended the ring to love this wearable technology! And let’s not forget that you don’t have to pay to use the RingConn app😉",5,2025-02-28T01:02:20.000Z,

"Great fit, super comfortable smart ring with the best battery by a wide margin.","The ring feels and looks great. Extremely comfortable to wear all day/night. Battery life is impressive and as good as it claims, unlike other competitors. But app needs work. UiX is a bit clunky and not intuitive.

There’s room for improvement.,"I like the ring sizing kit. It was more than what expected. I wear the actual ring every day. It is solid and comfortable. Also waterproof. I don’t have to take it off to shower. The only improvement that it needs is better accuracy of the oxygen monitoring. I wear a pulse oximeter (Wellue) that is very accurate. The ring, in comparison, reads 3-5 points higher consistently. If that could be improved, I would trust it more to wear alone and not have to use the extra device.
Hopefully the battery will hold its 7 day charge for a long time, which is another great feature.",4,2025-02-22T15:06:57.000Z,
"Lacks major connected app support. MFP, google health, etc...","This ring does no tnconnect well to 3rd pty apps

There is no google health support, which replaced fit, and is literally 1/2 of the market share for android phones in the US, probably the world.

Step syncing to fit is not 1:1 counts are horribly off, and remain that way, its not a syncing lag, its literally the wrong data.

The ring itself is awesome with a great app and amazing insights, but most of us are going to use My fitness pal, or some other health app, and neither are compatible with this device either

There are some easy wins here if Rongconn fixes this, but if your expecting this ring to fit your ecosystem you will be disappointed in the lack of connected app support.",2,2025-02-22T09:11:24.000Z,

It also has no subscription fee to use the app. A bonus is that the app shares data with Google Fit app, and I use both. My only complaint is once I confirmed the size, and changed my mind on color, the online order page never showed a change in choices or order status, then it took two weeks to arrive.

Great health monitor.,"The ring was slow to ship, but it has been worth the wait. I love the detailed information and functionality provided in the app all without a monthly subscription.

The only thing lacking is it's ability to pick up naps, but at least they can be manually added. Additional exercise options would be nice too.

Sort of good,"I bought the ring with the hope of replacing a monitoring band for sleep and stress tracking.
The experience has been ok...ish. It tracks your pulse and blood oxigen quite accurately. Also stress during the day is pretty accurate.
When it comes to sleep tracking, that's where things take a turn for the worse. While it is quite good in identifying when you go to sleep (it makes the difference between sleeping and just lying on the couch watching a movie), the actual sleep parameters, I find are quite off. You generally wake up to a sleep score of over 85 even on bad nights. HRV during the night, for me, was quite unchanged, whether I had a relaxation day or an intense workout day with lots of work besides it. It generally overshoots both REM and Deep Sleep, undershooting awake time.
Activity tracking is limited to walking, running and biking and only if location is turned on. This last part, for me, was enough reason to not use it as an activity tracker.
On the plus side, support is really fast on answering questions and addressing problems, however, I do not know how much of the feedback they use for improvement.

I hope the heart rate and blood oxygen numbers are accurate as I am using those for tracking sleep apnea events. I would appreciate an easy way of getting the data to a computer for better and more detailed analysis. While I wear the ring all the time I do not find much value using it while walking and working out at the gym.

I really enjoy the RingConn 2,"I really enjoy the RingConn 2, but after comparing it to the Oura Ring 4 for over a month now, the difference in sleep detection is WAY off. Most often it will be off by 1-2 hours. I do notice the heart rate is very close to the Oura Ring 4 and Apple Watch, it is almost spot on with my pulse ox. Just my biggest complaint is the sleep detection, once I adjust the time manually the REM and Deep Sleep are about 90% of the time very similar to the Oura Ring 4. The one benefit of the RingConn 2 though is the no subscription, it is a one time buy and that’s it. For that, I have to change my original rating of 3 stars to 4 stars.",4,2025-02-21T00:58:39.000Z,

Super disappointed,"I loved the ring at first, loved the data and keeping track of my health. But after six months the battery will no longer hold a charge and it is basically useless. I contacted ringconn and they insist that I do a bunch of troubleshooting and track data for two weeks to prove that it’s not working. They refuse to replace it until I’ve done this, and I have my doubts that they will replace it even then. I guess that’s the risk you take when you try a new product that hasn’t been around long enough to really test. I’m so disappointed by the quality and lack of customer service.",1,2025-02-19T20:33:18.000Z,

It tracks all the right things, but doesn’t always stay well connected to my phone which makes me question accuracy. Also a competitor has the option to be woken up when in light sleep rather than deep sleep and if that could be in the next update that would be huge for me. I would be open to more notifications too because I feel like I’ve only gotten them when the battery was dying.

My ring simply doesn't accurately track…,"Based on my experiences over the past two weeks of continuous use—both during the day and at night—I have some concerns about the RingConn's activity tracking accuracy. Specifically, I've noticed that the sleep tracking data appears to be significantly off. For example, on the first two nights, despite getting nearly 7 hours of sleep, the app recorded only about half that duration. I initially expected that ongoing use might help refine the sleep tracking algorithm, but so far, the nightly data has not improved.

For additional context, I primarily wear the ring on my left index finger, and occasionally on my middle finger, where it fits perfectly. As a comparison, I monitored my sleep with an Apple Watch, which consistently recorded around 7 hours of sleep each night. This contrast between the two devices leads me to question the overall reliability of the RingConn in tracking sleep and daily activity accurately.",2,2025-02-05T21:58:39.000Z,

Pro and cons,"The sleep tracking is quite accurate and stable compared with many other trackers. The heart rate monitor too.
The app is just right, simple and not overwhelming.
It doesn't feel bulky wearing it.
The step tracking is actually very bad, sometimes I get up in the morning, I get to the kitchen and I have 300 steps counted.
The exercises are very very limited, there is nothing about anaerobic exercises such as bodyweight.
I hate the fact that I need the charger to exit airplane mode, in 2025 it shouldn't be. I can't wear it while welding ( which is a big part of my job) and my phone drains the battery looking for the ring, if I put it in airplane mode I need to bring the charger with me, but most of smart ring wearers do it because of the very small size of it and if I need to bring the charger at work it loses part of the porpoise.

Best smart ring,"Amazing Innovation – The RingCon Smart Ring is a Game-Changer!

I recently purchased the RingCon Smart Ring, and it has completely exceeded my expectations. This innovative device seamlessly blends style, functionality, and advanced technology into a sleek, wearable gadget that has quickly become an essential part of my daily life.

Compact Yet Powerful

Despite its small size, the RingCon Smart Ring offers a wide array of features. From fitness tracking to health monitoring, it delivers accurate and reliable data, all at the tip of your finger—literally! It’s hard to believe how much technology is packed into such a lightweight and comfortable accessory.

Health and Fitness Tracking

The fitness tracking capabilities are outstanding. It tracks heart rate, steps, calories burned, and even sleep patterns with impressive accuracy. I love waking up and checking the detailed breakdown of my sleep cycle, which has helped me make significant improvements to my routine.

Seamless Connectivity

Pairing the ring with my smartphone was quick and effortless. The app is intuitive, with a clean interface that makes it easy to access insights and reports. Notifications and alerts from my phone are subtle yet effective, ensuring I stay connected without the constant distraction of checking my device.

Stylish Design

The RingCon Smart Ring is as stylish as it is functional. Its sleek, minimalist design makes it perfect for everyday wear, whether I’m at the gym, at work, or out for the evening. It doesn’t feel bulky or intrusive, and I’ve received countless compliments on its modern aesthetic.

Battery Life That Impresses

One of the standout features is the impressive battery life. A single charge lasts several days, which is incredibly convenient. I never feel tied down by constant charging, which is a huge bonus for any wearable device.

Durability and Comfort

The ring is made with high-quality materials that are not only durable but also comfortable for all-day wear. I barely notice it on my finger, and it holds up well to daily activities, including workouts and washing my hands.

Why I Recommend It

The RingCon Smart Ring is the perfect combination of practicality, style, and cutting-edge technology. Whether you’re looking to improve your health, stay connected, or simply own an innovative piece of tech, this ring is a fantastic choice.

Final Thoughts

RingCon has truly outdone itself with this smart ring. It has quickly become a staple in my routine, and I can’t imagine going back to life without it. If you’re on the fence about purchasing one, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try. You won’t regret it!

Five stars for this incredible product!",5,2025-01-14T04:23:03.000Z,
Buyer Beware,"Hello Everyone, I was one of the original backers of RingConn. For us Ringcon promised a 2 year warranty. My ring has stopped working correctly after a year and half and now needs to be charged daily. They have said/admited that this should not happen and it is a warranty issue. They have really handled my defective ping poorly. They offered only $110 towards a Gen2 ring which is a joke. When I said no they offered to send me a new gen 1 ring. Both options are not good but at least the gen 1 replacement is better. I accepted that option. Now they're saying they don't have it and not sure when they will and they just expect me to wait. I've also read they are not manufacturing any more Gen 1 rings so it seems they just hope this will go be forgotten and go away. This is crazy. I have asked them to escalate this issue but I can feel the pushback like afraid to escalate to a manager. Also, it's sometimes days at a time before I receive a response back from them. The rings are not cheap as we all know. They have handled this very poorly and in my mind unacceptable if they were a reputable company.",1,2025-01-14T00:21:24.000Z,

Love this ring! - from a newbie smart ring owner,"Ring is extremely well-made, with comfortable slim fit, much less bulky than any other ring on the market. Fit is slightly different than sizing kit, but this is most likely due to the smooth, slick internal coating of the ring versus the plastic material of the sizer. Comfortable to wear all day and all night. I find that the app is well-made, and although the app update changed the look of the main metrics page, it is intuitive and appears pretty accurate, particularly from a sleep tracking perspective. And the sleep score is extremely helpful--even when I get adequate or at least better length of sleep, I can associate my quality of rest accurately with a good or bad sleep score. Nap auto-detection is particularly impressive. I only wish workout detection was automatic and there were more options for workout types.",5,2024-12-14T19:37:54.000Z,

Great ring but software could be improved,"I love my RingConn ring. As I also own the gen 3 Oura ring I feel that I can provide a meaningful perspective.

Pros: RingConn has a slimmer profile, longer battery life, and best of all, no monthly fee. In addition, I have a rare limitation in that the Oura ring doesn't accurately read my heart rate, while both gen 1 and gen 2 versions of the RingConn read my heart rate flawlessly.

Cons: Where RingConn falls short is that some of the software aspects are not quite as good as Oura. For example, Oura has much better accuracy at reading when I'm awake vs being asleep. Many times where the RingConn shows me sleeping, the Oura accurately recognized that I was awake and reading a book. Another area where RingConn falls short is that there is no integration with partner software, so it doesn't recognize workouts I might have done that are recorded on Strava and Apple Health.

The RingConn app is good with lots of useful information. I find that the AI aspect is not very useful and gets in the way of just looking at the data. In contrast, Oura has a slightly more meaningful UI that makes it easier to understand the data presented.

Overall I can recommend the RingConn. It's solid, reliable and the lack of a monthly membership fee is a welcome benefit.",4,2024-12-13T07:33:01.000Z,

I seem to be having connectivity issues with the G2 as it is disconnecting more often than the G1 would. The largest size ring 14 is a little tight for my hand but that's not a big deal,larger size would be great. Overall very pleased with performance and data collected.
Pros: light weight,aesthetics good,accurate readings,app easy,battery life good.
Cons: random disconnect, reset through charger,size for me personally need larger,has on occasions connected to random phone of friend( no data transfer to random phone though) mindful of scratching when using weight exercise( normal with any ring).

My experience has been great,My experience has been great. I was excited why I found out at the ringcon2 and preorders from kick starter. So how I did receive my email/code to preorder on their site. I reached out them think it would be to late and sorry we can't do anything type of response. To my surprise it was literally the opposite. They seemed genuinely sorry that I didn't get the emails/links. Even know it was still past the time they created a link/code that allowed me to still get the presale deal. But then they also followed up to make sure it worked for me and I was able to do. That is what I called amazing customer service. As for the ring it's self I'm in love with it. My wife has the Samsung ring and my sister has the Aura. I have better battery life and I like interface better also. Great product and amazing customer service. I will say to be transparent the one thing I do not like is the ring protector. I've tried two different sizes to see if I maybe grow to liking it. Nope sorry. It made the ring seem bulky and cheap. That's saying a lot saying this ring is smaller then the others. I have large hands and it's the perfect size. It's not so tiny thits dainty but not large. It's like the perfect size for for anyone. Sorry guys about ring protector just have to be honest. Otherwise customer for life and recommend the ring hands down.

Amazing ring,"First, I'll start with the obvious. The battery life is amazing. You have to think so seldom about it while it collects the data. Second, the fit is wonderful. Much thinner than the test ring. I usually hate rings, but this one just found a permanent home. Have gotten so many compliments. I've only had it for a month, but haven't scratched or scuffed it yet. Connectivity always works (which is refreshing).

On the it's ok side is the app. Some elements are great others are annoying. I actually liked the app version I started with much more than the current version. They updates a week or so in and it was disappointing. The plan and AI elements are more in the way for me now. Most of this tech is new, so it's likely to improve.

Emailed them after 30 days as still no refund. I then magically receive an email saying you refund is being processed. Why did I not receive that email initially? I'll now wait another 10 days for the refund to appear.",1,2024-12-05T09:47:55.000Z,
Customer Service is NOT a Priority,I didn’t get my discount on either of my 2 purchases for upgrading to the “Gen2”.

"The ring is great, but change it to show ""Total Calories again!""","The ring is great, 5 out of 5 and I really like the user interface, until the recent update, that's why the downgrade to 4 stars!

However, you changed the interface to show the KCAL Activity Calories vs. ""Total Carlories!"" Most people including me, want to see how many ""Total Calories,"" so we can adjust what we eat, etc. Activity Calories is good, but is not nearly as helpful in my opinion. I've never met anyone that has referred to, ""I burned 300 KCAL activity calories vs. I burned 2500 Total Calories for example."" Please change it back!!!",4,2024-12-02T16:22:18.000Z,

I love everything about my RingConn!,"I love everything about my RingConn!
I love that there is no charge for the app.
I love how light the ring is compared to the Ora ring.
I love how it gives me detailed information about my sleep such as my rem sleep , deep sleep , heart rate , and light sleep among other details.
The first thing I check in the morning is my sleep score.
This has helped me with getting to bed at an earlier time and has helped me cut way back on alcohol because it drastically affects your sleep score.
When I drink wine or stay up to late my sleep score is in the 60’s and my deep sleep and rem sleep are less than an hour.
Otherwise it’s in the high 80’s and mid 90’s and my deep sleep and rem sleep are over 2 hours each.
I love that it tracks all my steps without having to have my phone attached to me.
The only downside is ,it took 7 weeks for me to receive it. I guess it comes from overseas . It was definitely worth the wait . I love it!",5,2024-11-29T15:34:21.000Z,
Ring that never arrived,"After making a purchase, I've been waiting over a month for a ring that never arrived. Supposedly sent on 21.10, track has been lost on 29.10 somewhere in Holland. RingConn didn't resolve it, did not send another piece, and could not even say when it would be sent. I got the feeling that the company forced me to cancel as the price for the ring has been raised lately, so it's better for RingConn to sell a piece for $387 to another person instead of sending it to me, as I took faith in the company and made a preorder. So I've cancelled the order and now I am waiting for my money to be returned.
Contact is artificial and lacks real information. Very bad experience, I cannot recommend buying from RingConn from anyone from my friend, unless they surprise me by something in the end.",1,2024-11-29T15:34:10.000Z,

great experience overall except for few…,"great experience overall except for few things, ring is comfortable but the lack of mid-sizes with .5 increments is an issue. People genuinely between 8 and 9, for example, or 7 & 8, struggle with the sizing.
Price is really high for the apps limited offerings, and the sleep data is not accurate sometimes and needs a way to edit it in detail not all of it at once. That's a huge issue that affects overall trends in my opinion. Overall like the ring, battery is great, outside of it is matte which I love, but looks plastic to others lol. Most importantly - #1 reason I bought it, NO subscription, if that stays I keep using it. That's what helps this company overtake the main leading one in the industry.",4,2024-11-28T23:32:04.000Z,

Awesome ring!,"This ring packs a powerful punch, so don’t let the size fool you. I bought a lot of smart rings to test a lot of them out and this one by far is the best in the market! First thing is I like that it’s thin because that makes a huge difference since some of them are just so thick, It’s uncomfortable to work with. Battery life is exactly what they State, it lasts just about two weeks or so. Other rings if they’re constantly running in the background like measuring heart rate or pulse ox. For example, it drains the battery like crazy but this ring does not. To me there’s no point of wearing a smart ring If it’s not going to constantly measure the details without dying so quick. The price of the ring to me is pretty fair considering what you’re expecting to work out of a good item. The saying you buy cheap you get cheap is exactly the case with all these smart rings. And the material they make this out of does not damage easily at all, which is another big plus for me if you are rough. The measurements are very accurate because I put it to the test; since I work in the medical field, it makes it a little bit easier to measure things. So overall, this is an excellent ring to keep track of things If you don’t always want to use your Apple Watch or any smart watch for that matter. I have used this for a few months now, so I can accurately measure If it lives up to the expectations.The only thing I hope that they add in the next software update would just be to measure blood pressure. Since all the other smart rings do that and for this one measuring everything under the sun, they just didn’t add blood pressure check. So I hope to see that shortly, but looking forward to the third generation whenever it comes out!",5,2024-11-28T17:11:12.000Z,

Disappointed... lack of support & service,"I’m quite disappointed with the service. I ordered the RingConn Gen 2, but instead of the correct sizing kit, your team sent me the Gen 1 sizing kit. When I tried to resolve this through your support team, they took days to respond. When they finally did, they instructed me to place an order using the Gen 1 sizing kit.
Following their advice, I ordered a size 12, but it feels a size larger. If I had been provided the correct Gen 2 sizing kit, I might have chosen a size 11 instead, as the thinner design of Gen 2 offers less resistance.
To make matters worse, the package was supposed to include the ring protector, but it wasn’t included. After reaching out again, I received the wrong size protector (M instead of L for a size 12 ring). At this point, I didn’t even bother contacting support again—I’m simply too exhausted and frustrated by the repeated mistakes and lack of accountability.",2,2024-11-28T15:25:56.000Z,

I would be glad to pay any additional cost. Thanks for giving me a chance to air my frustration. Joyce",1,2024-11-28T03:39:55.000Z,

"Great data, good hardware, awful UI.","The hardware seems to work as expected and I had no problems with delivery. The battery life is insanely good. The ring is very slim and comfortable. The weak point is the paint (matte black). It is already starting to scuff after only a week. I was hoping it was more robust. I also wish they had a size 15 ring. The 14 does not fit my index or middle fingers. The recent UI update is atrocious.

I originally chose RingConn because it was efficient at showing simple raw data. I was willing to put up with a beta interface assuming it would become more professional and exceed competitors.

The recent UI update is inefficient with the data, and the beta AI w/emojis, smiley faces, and colorful flowers doesn’t match the rings original audience. The AI literally just tells you what you see if you saw the data charts. The UI change feels like a bait and switch from the original portrayal of the app software.

Besides being silly looking, If someone has blurry vision or color blindness, the butt-leaf clover is very difficult to work with compared to the previous diamond. It looks blurry, and is a downgrade in function.

Hopefully RingConn fixes it soon.",2,2024-11-28T00:19:31.000Z,

Inaccurate data,"have had the “Smart Ring” RingConn for about 2 months.
My first impression is that the ring is well made and
seems to have some sophisticated technology.
Simply put the functions as indicated on the Ring main screen are sleep, Stress,
activity, and heart Rate. It provides a lot of data on each function.
Personally I find the data almost overwhelming and squeezed together.
What I have found, in my brief time, with the Ring is that under Activity, (Steps)
is that they are inaccurate. I have a pedometer and an apple watch and they both
record similar readings in steps taken. Also the ring does not provide distance for
the Steps. If you know how many steps you should know the approximate distance.
The RingConn is way off, on average 200-600 steps. This is unacceptable
and I would think “Skews” the data on other applications on the Ring.
The “Heart rate”(BPM) is also suspect during activity. No clear way to test except by my
Watch and that indicates a discrepancy.
I am disappointed that the Ring does not capture the most basis function of exercise(steps)
in an accurate manner and heart rate.
I did contact RingConn about the steps issue and got a response promptly but
the answer was sort of undefined and in no way an answer to solving the issue.
I have “reset” the Ring several times but that did not change the accuracy of the steps.
I will try it for a little while longer then I will have chalk this up to some devices are
not up to the task.
I would not buy this ring if you expect it to record the basic function of tracking your
Exercise (Steps) or even distance and perhaps heart rate during activity.

Good gadget to track your sleep,"The Ring looks pretty good (obv. not as good as a accessory ring). The Appdesign is good and easy to understand.
It monitors sleep, HR and SpO2 very well. The HRV can only be measured precisely if ur hand is not moving. Accordingly, i don't know how much you can put on the stress index which the ring calculates based on the HRV which can't be recorded accurately during the day with all the movement.
The ring also overestimates the amount of steps taken, which is shown by the difference in steps measured by my phone and by the ring.
Also be aware, that the ring of the sizing kit is (i can only talk about my order) a little smaller than the actual ring.

I bought the ring to monitor my sleep, which is tracked very good, but only 4 stars due to sizing kit not being acurate and the HRV measuring as well as the overestimation of the steps (which for me is not very relevant)",4,2024-10-08T16:34:25.000Z,

Love this ring,Love this ring. It’s magical. Especially like that they aren’t demanding money for an ongoing subscription - it just downloads to the free app which is very detailed and integrates with other data collection systems. The data encourages me to exercise more consistently so as to get a good daily score. I’ve been able to use the ring when swimming and waterskiing as it appears to have the best waterproofing in the industry. I’m a big fan!,5,2024-10-07T16:07:56.000Z,

One discrepancy I'm finding is the ring is struggling to differentiate between me sitting in my chair quietly watching television and me being asleep in my bed.

For this reason, I have stopped wearing my ring 24 hours per day to get a more accurate picture of my sleep hours.

My only other wish would be that there could also be a web-based app rather than just a phone app.

Given the average age of the user probably points towards the older end of the scale, it would simply make it easier for my generation to be able to expand their readings and drill down more into their results to get a better understanding of them.",3,2024-08-08T02:17:29.000Z,

"Bad data, even worse customer service.","I purchased a RingConn in the spring and was deeply disappointed in my experience. I was promised accurate data, and it could not be more off.

I tried to return it the first week I got it, but RingConn never responded to my email and deleted my Instagram comments. I also ordered a ring protector from them the day it arrived and realized after 3 weeks it never even shipped.

I tried appealing it with my CC company, but was recently rejected for the ring, however received a refund (from the CC company) for the ring protector.

RingConn is serious about their return policy which shows me they know they have an inferior product that they do not stand behind. I highly recommend NOT purchasing this product and going with one of the better competitors!

It is a tad bit cumbersome to navigate and the data while interesting isn't as informative with suggestions, ideas to progress/improve and variable options/suggestions of ""how"" to improve and why. While I fully understand this is not necessarily a health product that supplements professional advice etc. I think the RingConn does have room for improvement in this area.

With the option to receive first the ring measure kit you couldn’t miss your right size. I toke almost one week before decide which size is the right one for me. I would wear the sample during my day’s activity to be sure it doesn’t get me uncomfortable and stressed.
I’m not sure about the reliable of the steps count, but I think they will improve the software time by time.
The external surface is well finished end seems enough scratch resistant for daily normal use.
You can wear without mind in your bath activities as it’s water resistant and neutral soap safe.

"The ring good, App needs to be improved","The ring itself is great and records the data properly, but the app needs to be improved. For example, the manually activated sports activities do not include training in enclosed buildings. This applies, for example, to fitness/machine training and also to ergometers and cross trainers. The ring's measurement and recording of pulse, calorie consumption, etc. also only works inadequately and inaccurately in these cases.",3,2024-06-29T14:14:34.000Z,

RingConn works hard for its Customers,"I have been using the ring since its inception, and with messenger we have built a strong community of people who help each other, and RingConn listens to what our concerns are. They are constantly improving the app, and now have had beta testers including me, to help in adding more and more functionality to the ring.

It has really improved in the sleep area immensely. That is why I bought it initially. It gives you a multitude of information about the quality of your sleep and it now adding sleep apnea for those who need it.

Where it needs the most improvement and it is working hard to do that, is tracking your exercise accurately. Whether on a bike or just walking they keep adding more yet the accuracy really still lags in many of those programs.

I can speak to the walking. I am 6' tall and long legged, and I can walk a mile in under 13 minutes, yet a 50 minute walk that my iPhone shows 3.8 miles, their beta app is showing only 2.8 miles quite a difference. The algorythym still needs a lot work, maybe they need to build in your height stride or whatever to get it more accurate, I will leave it to their programmers.

They are always willing to listen and improve, go out and buy this ring, you will not be disappointed!",4,2024-06-26T18:43:50.000Z,

Bigger Size please,"The RingCoon ring offers good quality and efficient battery management. The accompanying app is straightforward, which is beneficial as it covers all necessary functions without any unnecessary complexity. However, the widgets are redundant since they merely mirror the app's windows; it’s easier to open the app, sync, and check progress directly.

One drawback is the need to send data to the cloud for any results. The phone or app should process basic data locally, with cloud connectivity reserved for more detailed insights. Additionally, push notifications for ring software updates would be helpful. While frequent app usage might be encouraged for data collection, a notification for updates would benefit standard or IT users who sync less frequently.

Moreover, a larger size option would be awesome, as even the size 14 feels a bit small.",4,2024-06-24T21:23:00.000Z,

Sadly, 90% of the time the ring does not capture readings for many of the metrics, and I still have no understanding of how any of the insights related to stress are gathered.

"Good ring, but inaccurate HR readings while training","(Édit): I got the ring shortly after writing the review below. So far, so good. It is not very accurate for measuring the heart rate while training, it consistently measures a heart rate that is much lower than reality (130-140 vs 170bmp). I wish it also measured the skin temperature, but that seems to only work while sleeping for some reason.

For the delay, they did send me the ring protectors to compensate, but honestly, I will never wear these protectors. They are ugly and are a hassle to put on. I would rather put a glove or take the ring off if I feel I could scratch it.

(Previous review)
I wish I could review the ring, but Yuntrack is so damn slow to deliver that I am still waiting for it 4 weeks after ordering it… the sizing kit took 10 days to arrive and the ring, looks like it will take 14+ days.

In general I like the product,"In general I like the product. I went through 3 Wellue rings before trying this. It holds the charge as claimed which is amazing. It charges in 90 minutes or less as claimed, also amazing. The water resistant aspect is my most favorite part as I think I lost at least two of the previous brand because of that. I love that it is not bulky and looks like normal jewelry. I find most of the readings accurate when they are taken.

The things I would change if I could. Continuous readings for oxygen and heart rate. For some of us that are chronically ill, it is important to know in lass than 5 minutes if our oxygen drops. Along those lines, notifications when we have readings outside of certain settings. These are huge and frankly, I wouldn’t have bought the ring if I had more clearly understood. If it can send sedentary notifications, it should be able to send others. The sleep recording is way off. I am chronically ill. On really bad days I am sedentary for the better part of the day. The ring records that as sleep - and not just sleep, but deep sleep and REM sleep. This doesn’t seem appropriate.

Good So Far,"So far, my ring has been very good. The sizing and delivery was as advertised. I am very pleased with that. The ring case had a good charge when delivered, and it did not take a lot of time to charge the ring. It was easy to get everything installed, updated and operating. I put it into the case to charge when showering, and it stays close to 100%. But some tweaks are still necessary. The first day I cut the grass with a push mower. This registered as taking a nap. Also, I walk several Km daily and the ""outdoor walking"" selection on the app is not yet active, so my ring has yet to record any exercise. It does count my steps, a bit more freely than my phone pedometer app. Google Fit records my route, not the ring. I have not had any updates since receiving my ring, so I hope these anomalies are corrected. My sleep and other reading appear accurate. It is comfortable to wear.

Ringconn review,"What I like is the convenience. Put it on and forget about it. Being able to shower with it on is great. Stress and sleep measurements work well. The wellness balance suggestions are helpful. What I don't like is the heart rate and step counter measurements. They both only work correctly when your arm is moving. I work out on a stationary bike. I also wear another heart rate monitor on my arm. My other heart rate monitor will be reading 150 for example, however the ring thinks I'm inactive because I have my arms on the handle bars(not moving). I also don't get any credit for steps because my arm is not moving. So I don't get any credit for the whole workout. If you walk or run for exercise the ring is great. I also use a push mower to mow grass on a slopping lot. It is a great workout!! But my heart rate according to the ring will stay around 70 because my arms are on the mower handle(not moving). I also don't get any credit for steps for the same reason(arms not moving). If I take my arm off the bike or mower, the heart rate and steps are correct. Mowing and biking one handed is difficult and not sustainable. I do manage to reach my step goals, but I have to do extra walking or running to achieve it. I really do like the ring. I hope a firmware update will fix these issues.",3,2024-06-19T20:14:11.000Z,

Satisfaction Despite Challenges,"Review: Satisfaction Despite Challenges**

I had the pleasure of working with Isla as my guide, and I want to share my positive experience. Isla was always there for me and constantly provided guidance, even when there were issues with the delivery.

Let me detail my experience:

1. **Service**: The overall service was very good. Email response times were excellent, and I always felt well supported and informed.

2. **Delivery**: Delivery was challenging. It took significantly longer than I expected. Personally, I believe this should be communicated more clearly, as I couldn't find any information about the extended delivery times anywhere.

3. **Returns**: Returning items incurs a fee, which is understandable, but it would have been helpful to know this in advance.

4. **Ringconn Gadget App**: The app has room for improvement, from my perspective. More customer data might be needed to further optimize it.

5. **Overall Picture**: Despite some challenges, I'm overall satisfied with the experience. Isla's assistance played a significant role in this.

6. **Appreciation**: Dear Isla, you are the best. Thank you for your tireless efforts and excellent support.

Great smart ring!,I have had it for almost a week. The ring is working well. I haven’t had to charge it yet. The data is really informative and lots of insights about what different things mean and how to improve your health based on your data. I am happy with the ring so far. It does have a couple of scuffs on the inside of my hand from daily use but nothing too bad. No different from my wedding ring. Also the app is really easy to use and understand.,5,2024-06-14T19:10:39.000Z,

One of the best rings on the market.,"The app and ring connect together pretty well, and I haven’t seen any connection issues that aren’t resolved with a quick restart of the app. Sleep, stress and BPM/SP02 data is nicely laid out and the implications of the numbers are easy to understand. Not having to pay a subscription fee for the app is also a definite plus.
That said, it would be nice to partition sleep data over a single sleep period if possible. For example, if I go to sleep at 11 PM, wake up at 2 AM, and go back to sleep from 4 AM to 6 AM, the ring counts this as one continuous block of sleep from 11 - 6, which makes data inaccurate.",4,2024-06-14T00:55:55.000Z,

24 days to receive correct ring in NZ but good customer service,"After I placed my order it took about 10 days shipping from HK to NZ which is expected. However when I received the sizing kit I also received a default size 6 silver ring. I figured out that when I placed my order somehow the RingConn shopping cart didn't remove the default size 6 silver ring when I chose ""don't know my size"". Customer service responded the same day but it took a couple of days for them to arrange a pre-paid courier ticket for me to return the ring. Initially they wouldn't send the correct ring I wanted until they received it back in HK but after some pushing they conceded and shipped the correct ring. Again it took about 10 days. Overall from date of order to receiving the correct ring was 24 days which is disappointing but Customer service were communicative and overwhelmingly apologetic for the error which is appreciated when things do go wrong.

UPDATED,I ordered my boyfriend a RingConn because it’s seems like a pretty cool idea. I ordered it on 05/18 and got it 05/25. BUT I need to exchange the ring for a different size and it has been the WORST process ever. I have emailed them twice so far and called once (I wasn’t able to reach anyone at their number for 20 minutes then got a voicemail and left a message) still no response. I’ll update this review once they respond if they ever do but it sucks that you pay $300 and get NO communication if there are issues. It really seems like they don’t care about employee experience at all. If this continues I’ll just ask for a refund back but would not recommend it at all. Ours has much better customer service. UPDATE! They have assisted me in getting a replacement ring and were quite helpful. They suggested shipping a sizing thing but we knew the correct size so they just send us the ring and it even came quicker than the original ring. Thanks so much for your help Ringconn!,4,2024-06-08T16:46:42.000Z,
RingConn has a long way to go to bring their customer service up to par,"So far the ring performs as advertised. I wish I could give it a better rating but the issues I had with customer service overshadowed the experience in ways I won’t soon forget.

My ring was lost in shipping and the support group at RingConn was slow, unhelpful and condescending in handling my issue. After many messages to support and responses that were days late or failed to address my issue, RingConn finally agreed to ship me a new ring. I requested overnight shipment to make up for the lost time and frustration I experienced and they disregarded my request completely, instead sending a new ring three days later via USPS. They repeatedly disregarded my request to have a supervisor contact me.

Several days later I received two rings on consecutive days. No sooner had the second ring arrived than I began getting urgent messages from RingConn to return it. They asked me to take it to a shipping location which I refused to do. I used a shipping label they provided and left it out for my postman to pick up.

I have rarely experienced such incompetent service nor have I been disregarded as completely as I was by RingConn. I was far more diligent in sending back the second ring than they were in addressing my concerns. I only hope I don’t have an issue with the ring, since I have no confidence RingConn will stand behind their product.

Follow up 05/27/2024:
I received a lengthy response from RingConn after posting my review. Like all their communications, it was vague and did not address my concerns. I have dealt with online sellers of many products for decades and have never been treated so disrespectfully. I've wasted enough time on this.

Customer service TERRIBLE,"I got my ring a little over a month ago. It stopped holding a charge already. You submit your concern through the app, but it usually takes 2 days for them to get back to you. They said that they would send me a return label two days ago, all I needed to do was confirm my address and that I am ready to mail it. I confirmed, but then they e-mail back today asking me to confirm my ring size (so I'm sure they won't get back to me for another 2 days). It just seems they drag things out quite a bit. I haven't been able to use my ring for 10 days - and will be much longer at the rate of their customer service.

Update June 2: Due to the poor customer service, I requested a refund. On May 22, they said my refund was of “utmost importance” and that they would be following it “very closely”. They said I should get it in 2-3 business days. But after 7 business days, I still have yet to receive my refund.

Quite honestly - the customer service (or lack thereof) should be enough to discourage anyone from purchasing this ring.",1,2024-06-03T17:44:02.000Z,

SO2 function and sleep function incorrect,The purchase etc went fine. But having used it now I find that the SO2 measurement on the ring during sleep has changed to a much lower reading. I check with another gadget I have and that I know meets medical standards and that one shows antwo point higher average. More or less what I had when I started using the ring. Ni don’t know what changed but this basically makes the ring useless for me as I had bought it specifically to measure that. Also two nights ago I barely slept and was awake most of the night. I got a 96 score on my sleep which is even higher than nights where I know the sleep was mixed. I would like to return my ring and get a refund.

I feel the step counts are far more accurate, the sleep stuff is fascinating and enlightening, heart rate, oxygen, and all that are easy to read. I'm most enjoying the Stress sensor, I love to drive but the Ring has shown me how stressed I am while driving. I can see it now, but I had no idea at the time.

Latest App Update a Disaster.,"For several months I found the ring to be very helpful in analyzing my sleep. The data provided me with a chart of my sleep stages during the night. Within the past few weeks however the app was ""updated"" and I no longer have access to the sleep data chart, only a single number, telling me my total sleep for the night. No more data telling me the amount of light sleep. deep sleep, and REM sleep. I sent in a request to have the problem fixed but the reply was totally unsatisfactory, telling me it would be fixed with the next upgrade. That might be months, if at all. I bought the ring based on the data presentation that I was initially provided, not on the very abbreviated presentation I now have. I have no idea why the company would take such a huge step backward. I did not buy the ring based on the skimpy data that is now provided. I have no choice but to demand a return of my money.",1,2024-05-04T22:27:05.000Z,

When I got my actual ring, it was way too big for my index finger and kept sliding off. I reached out to the company to see if I could return it for a size 9 (I did know that all sales are final, but I explained that the ring wasn't the same size as the sizing ring) and was told no and to try a different finger. I do wear my ring on my middle finger because the ring wasn't cheap, but it looks awful!

Ring works amazing. I love how handles the sleep/nap and stress. It's pretty light, battery lasts for a week and app was translated recently to Spanish so can't be more happy with it.

My experiences after half a year of use,"The ring is almost unnoticeable. The ring battery lasts 6 days. The charging box also includes a battery and you can charge the ring in the box several times before you have to charge the box's battery. Ideal if you are traveling without electricity for several weeks. The ring has integrated memory and does not have to be permanently connected to the cell phone. When the connection is restored, the measurement data is sent to the cell phone and the cloud. The app is very clear and easy to understand. The positive thing is that it doesn't require a subscription and the app is therefore free. The app is available in multiple languages and Ring Conn is constantly working to improve the app. You can actively start measurements yourself in the app. Ring Conn Support always strives to provide a solution to questions as quickly as possible. I can recommend this product with a clear conscience. I hope I was able to answer a few questions for those interested in the recession. Greetings David",5,2024-04-26T08:55:59.000Z,

6-months review…,"I’ve had my RingConn ring for exactly 6 months now. It has given very reliable results over this time period with no significant problems, particularly helping me track sleep and steps. The step-tracking feature has definitely been a helpful motivator in getting me active most every day. Although I did need to learn exactly how it was measuring ‘steps’ - which was not the number of times my feet touched the ground, but was actually the number of times my arms would swing freely as I walked. For instance I did need to learn to carry my grocery bag with my right hand in the store and let my left (ring) hand swing freely, if I wanted my shopping walking to count. But it’s basically been an extremely effective - and also very unobtrusive - device for helping me monitor these health & wellness functions.",5,2024-04-24T22:17:56.000Z,

Found the vitals/ Heart Rate - HRV-Spo2 oxygen Sleep to be extremely accurate when testing against other equipment I have.
Sleep Apnea is under testing as is fertility tracking as I write this review

Overall this ring has made a massive difference how I track my health- don’t use Apple Watch for that anymore - no more bulky watch at night for sleep tracking- each day i track my vitals to see how I’m doing,

Love the customer care team and feedback team - very proactive - they have a great group where everyone asks questions and give their views and RingConn interact directly with people in group on Facebook

Overall 5 stars - love the ring and regular updates wether young and healthy for sports tracking or older like myself - I find this ring a great asset for tracking my health - well done RingConn for being proactive in developing this ring and keeping on top-with regular updates

A great concept that could use improvements,"1- the lack of half sizes was a problem for me. I had to choose either a ring that was too tight or two loose. When I contacted the company for help, they were very noncommittal, basically telling me that neither would be a good idea. Well, duh. I ultimately decided on too loose because I still wanted to be able to get the ring off if I was bloated or on a hot day. That resulted in nearly losing the ring a couple of times on very cold days because it fell right off my finger! I finally solved this by purchasing a very thin, cheap ring in my size from Amazon which I wear on top of my RingConn to keep it from falling off.

2- the Wellness Balance is not explained clearly. I check it, but other than my sleep & activity, it's not really intuitive what information I'm getting from my vital signs & stress scores. More info would be more helpful.

3- they started giving wellness badges. Ok. Cool. What exactly am I tracking?

4- I pretty much use this to track my steps. It's a lot more comfortable than an apple watch.

5- I do appreciate being able to use the app without a subscription, which is why I chose this over another ring on the market.

Amazing ring with a amazing app,"I've had the ring for ≈5 months now and so far I'm very happy with it.

The app is updated very frequently with new features being added. Since I got the ring there has been an updated summary as well as new features to tack outdoor running.

All my contact with the company has been really great as well. I order the protector and received a size small er than I ordered. They quickly corrected their mistake and I got 2 new protector of the correct size a few days later. I even were able to change the size after having submitted a smaller size than I actually wanted.

The ring itself is very nice and both feels and looks great. It's very comfortable to wear and I usually forget that I'm even wearing it. It's great at tracking sleep and over-all activity. Although the downside is that it's quite inaccurate when working out in a gym and the heart rate seems to be far off. But at the same time, it's not an activity tracker and I don't expected it to be as accurate for workouts as a fitness tracker.",5,2024-04-19T11:09:01.000Z,

the sleep and stress info is decent but that's about it.

So Far So Good,"My Ring experience has been good so far. I have had my Ring about 5 or 6 months. Fit and delivery were fast and easy. The quality of the ring itself is good and the brushed aluminum finish is nice, subtle and does not scratch very easily. The ring charges quickly and is easy to do using their included pod style charger. I wish syncing was a bit faster or even bet automatic each day. The FREE app is a nice touch for following your information. It is well laid out and easy to read and understand after just a few uses. There have been a continuous stream of updates to the app and ring so that has been a nice upside. Kudos to the dev team! Overall I am very happy with my purchase. My one piece of advice (no matter what ring you purchase is to decide what you are really looking to get out of the information they provide and will you use it to make informed decisions). I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could as it's not perfect but pretty great overall.",4,2024-04-17T19:57:12.000Z,
I love my RingConn ring!,"I love my ring! (silver color)
Keeps me aware of my stress level, if I'm getting enough sleep or need to focus more on it, steps, consistency, etc. Does exactly what I wanted it to do. I really like wearing all of my rings, (I have many in stainless steel and sterling silver and it blends well with all of them. I constantly get compliments on my rings and they have no idea that one of them is a health tracker until I mention it...IF I do! Lol) so this is a perfect health tracker for me, vs. wrist versions, that I've also had easily break or wear out on me, so I LOVE this option and even more so since they aren't just trying to take advantage with yet another monthly subscription!!!

I’ve gone through the steps on your support page to remedy the problem, but I haven’t had any success.

At this juncture, the only recommendation I can offer is to fix what I mentioned above and allow the customer the choice to set whether or not they want to receive a daily summary of how they slept the night before. The notification can say something like, “here is your sleep summary from last night.” I often forget to check my dashboard in the morning because I’m busy getting ready for my day. Consequently, I don’t check it until later or forget altogether. Other than that, I think you have a great product, and it is performing as expected. I hope this helps.",4,2024-04-17T13:31:06.000Z,

Neurodivergent helpful - detailed sleep and stress,"The ring is crafted well and never feels too warm or tight/loose with the two bumps, which was something I was worried about before owning it.

What sold me on this ring and why I'm still very happy with it is that I'm a neurodivergent person that struggles with things like severe ADHD and a very common comorbidity of that, Insomnia.

Having a ring that accurately tracks whenever you sleep no matter the time and understands and displays sleep stages has been so useful for me to track and understand so much more about my sleep needs and patterns. Including learning I have my most efficient and restful sleeps with the best ratio of Deep and REM sleep stages when I sleep between 5-6 hours vs more/less hours.

It also tracks stress levels very well that compares and outdoes what my apple watches did for me in the past. But on a ring on my finger instead of a watch that has a poor battery.

It is also been surprisingly durable and waterproof to where I can just forget it is on. I do tend to take it off to charge while I shower, but it's not due to not being able to shower with it on, I just found that to be the most convenient and efficient way to keep my ring charged without interrupting my schedule.

I had issues with my ring not keeping charge more than 3 days after 2 months of use and they without hesitation mailed me a replacement to use within the same week. This second one has kept its charge same as when I first got it and lasts 7 days but I charge mine more often as mentioned so i rarely have to push it unless I just forget to take it off when I shower.

Speaking of the case, it is just great. I rarely ever have to plug in the case to charge. Maybe once a month, or longer?

Very very happy with it. Only improvements I want to see more of is just more features on the app but those are already promised and even within the time of purchasing it until now there have already been new features and bug fixes added routinely which is always a good sign of a healthy app development cycle and a team that is organized and follows agile methodology. (I'm a software engineer, so it's easier to spot 😅).

For the price this is such a good investment for me and I'm happy to have jumped onto the ringconn bandwagon over the others I had researched in comparison.

"Pretty good ring, but swelling of finger a major issue","My RingConn ring has been an interesting experience. I purchased this as part of a Black Friday sale. I needed a ring sizing kit, and this was sent to me, although I felt it was dispatched and delivered a bit slowly. I decided on a ring size after wearing the ""sizing"" ring a couple of days. I wanted the ring to be worn on my non-dominant hand. The ring arrived in a reasonable time after I selected the ring size online. It charged up properly. The set up was okay, but I did feel that RingConn's app was asking for too much personal information such as my home address. It should be asking only for the rock bottom minimum information from the user. My home address is not needed for a health tracking application.

After a time, it became clear to me that the RingConn app installed on my iPhone was rather basic, but it seemed to be sending my health data to a server somewhere on the internet. For example, to get a report of my health data (such as the stress score, sleep trends, step counts) over time, the information appears to be made available from a server. I have no idea if this information is encrypted on the remote server(s) or not and what other parties have access to my personal data...such as my daily sleep patterns.

Even so, for a almost 4 months, it was fun to wear my ring daily, 24 hours a day, except in the shower or when doing some messy chores with my hands like washing dishes. It was fun seeing the trends develop over time. But then, quite recently, a problem developed. The finger that I used for my ring seemed to start swelling. I could not get the ring off easily. Perhaps this is tied to increasing physical activity on my part, or warmer temperatures as the short winter ended and Spring arrived. I am not sure. My skin came off a bit the last time I wrenched the ring off my finger...not a lot of skin...and there was really almost no pain...but there was some minor bleeding that stopped quickly. I decided I had better stop wearing the ring. Recently, my finger has healed enough to put the ring back on, but the fit is so tight that I'm afraid I'll injure the finger again when I need the ring to come off.

So I'm not sure what to do. I wish I could have ordered a quarter-size larger (for example, ring size 9.25 instead of 9) or a half-size larger (as in 9.50.) I have given the ring to my wife, since she is interested in RingConn.

I think that eventually, health tracking rings need to be constructed from flexible materials that can accept some amount of physical expansion or contraction. I think ring materials that are flexible in this way are very necessary for me. I don't understand why my finger swelled, and perhaps it will contract this coming winter with cooler temperatures. But the ring is useless to me if it cannot fit on my finger ""just right"".

Also, it is important for customers to feel that their personal information is safe; that it will not be sold to third parties for any reason; that it is secured such that even RingConn employees cannot decrypt someone's personal information; that it cannot be decrypted by third parties; and that even if the data is stolen by thieves, it cannot be decrypted by them, either (even if the thieves wait a few years and try to decrypt at that future date.)

Overall, I like the idea of a health tracking ring, but the materials need to be improved and the security of my personal data really needs to be assured.",2,2024-04-17T03:58:37.000Z,

Overall a good purchase,"I like my ring overall. I have been wearing it for 3 months. It offers a lot of information and the app works well. I like that I can compare days and see weekly overview. I wish the ring came in half sizes. I went up a size because I know my fingers will be larger in summer heat, but I have found there are days I can't wear my ring when it's cool for fear it will fall off. I fear that also make the readings less accurate. I do agree with other reviewers that the steps are inaccurate. My ring shows a much lower count that my Apple watch.

Happy/Sad,"Hello;
Firstly, my experience with the ring was nothing short of great. The metrics it accumulated were very precise. The sad part of this journey is that I lost the ring on a jobsite. It fit wonderfully, though I believe I lost it in a clients heated floor. It has been a month and a bit since it's been lost, and I am struggling with the decision if I will replace it. I tried a silicone cover, but they degraded quickly. I would also suggest a 'find function' on the ring (similar to the find my phone app). Overall, I have nothing but praise for the functionality of the ring, just disappointed that I lost it.",4,2024-04-13T15:39:08.000Z,

"A few minor changes, and it's a 5-star ring.","The Ringconn's extended battery life is an advantage. However, the feature set could benefit from further enhancement. It lacks distinctive features that differentiate it from competitors. Still, the absence of a subscription requirement was a compelling factor in my initial selection of Ringconn as an introduction to smart rings. But, the limited functionality is prompting me to consider alternative options, as it does not fully replace any of my other devices or even limit how much I use them. I would give it five stars if it tracked workouts and shared data with Nike, Samsung, Apple, or other major fitness trackers and somehow notified me of missed calls and texts from specific contacts.

I would say the delivery times could use some improvement, it took almost 4 weeks to receive the Ring sizing kit, had another week to receive the actual Ring itself. I also wish they had a polished version, I have the silver one, and it looks quite dull compared to my other jewellery, however that’s quite an petty observation, given the functionality of the unit.

I love the sleep tracking, it’s really helped me to actively improve the quality of my sleep. I’ve noticed a direct correlation between the number of steps I get each day and the quality of my sleep and HRV.

Good passive solution,"I am satisfied with the design, the application and the ""passive"" logic of use. Smart bracelets always annoyed me when they alert me to something, they always want some kind of interaction, the ring is a really great solution in this perspective. Plus I can wear a normal classic analog watch. The ring has a very good battery life and the charging solution is elegant.
I give four stars because the application still needs to develop some functionalities, for example different types of exercises. And you need to realize that the number of measured steps is always a little overestimated (it's logical, every person waves his hand all the time, not only while walking)",4,2024-04-05T08:47:34.000Z,

Difficult for big hands,The ring is somewhat uncomfortable to wire especially when grasping door nobs etc. While ringconn has the best selection of sizes large hands are left out just like the competition. This was the only manufacturer whose ring would fit my right hand ring finger vice index finger which would have more comfortable to wear. I like the battery lasting seven days mostly. Charging is very easy and fast. It would be handy to have a visible way to know the ring is in right position when worn. I currently use a dab of finger nail polish so I can quickly verify the rings position. The price of the ring is fair. To be fair I recognize the problem with manufacturing for other than the most popular sizes.,4,2024-04-05T01:50:07.000Z,

I also have a Fitbit Charge 5 and a Garmin Venu 3 and I find the RingConn the best in these categories. Small and unassuming - doesn't get in the way. Runs many days without requiring a charge, and the small charge case is perfect because it doesn't require you to plug into a wall outlet all the time (I have had the ring since February and have yet to recharge the charge case).

I like that there's no monthly fee. I highly recommend Ring Conn. I have nothing bad to say about it at all. In fact I had a Galaxy Watch 6 and had lots of issues with it not storing or syncing data.

This is the fitness ring to get,"After exhaustively researching the”Big 4” names in fitness rings (Oura, Circular, Ultrahuman and RingConn), I chose RingConn. RingConn was less expensive, had a lot of excellent (and believable) reviews and, perhaps most importantly, has NO MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION/EXTORTION FEE (which other companies should be absolutely ashamed to charge for such an expensive product). The RingConn ring isn’t quite as nice-looking as some of the others, but it looks absolutely fine, so I have no regrets on that front.

I’ve been wearing the ring for 2+ months. It took a few days for the ring to “get to know” me and provide what appeared to be accurate data, but it has been rock-steady and excellent ever since. The results are consistent with (and I think more accurate than) my Galaxy Watch’s sleep data. (The only thing which confuses both my RingConn and my Galaxy watch is my bed’s vibrating massage function; using it typically results in inaccurate sleep data.). The RingConn app provides detailed information, but is very user-friendly and easy to understand. The few times I found errors in the data (which turned out to be caused by the bed’s massage function), I submitted a ticket through the app and received a satisfactory response within a day. The charging box is the best charging system of any ring; it is super-convenient and works flawlessly. I typically charge the ring every few days while I take a shower just because that’s convenient, but based on the battery level readings in the app, one charge would last 6-7 days.

I’m glad I did so much research before choosing RingConn. This brand seem to be the underdog of fitness rings at the moment, but I would not be surprised if they end up the leader. IMHO, RingConn’s product design, accuracy, price, customer service and pay-once model leave the others in the dust.",5,2024-03-29T21:15:06.000Z,

It seems to make the data up,"Initially all seemed well. Long wait to receive the ring during the Kickstarter campaign, but the company tried to keep people updated, even though their own spreadsheet didn't match up with delivery volumes and dates.
After wearing the ring for a few months, I've been receiving worrying heart rate data of very high heart rate. These figures didn't match up at all with a smart watch readings, or an external blood pressure monitor.
Heart rate around 60bpm, ring sometimes records resting heart rate 170-220bpm. During these high heart rate recording other devices track a higher heart rate of 80-100bpm, but no where near the figures RingConn records. And these are not brief blips of a minute or two, but 30-60 minute periods.
I have contacted RingConn on a few occasions, sending them data showing the high reading and just receive a standard copy and paste reply, basically fobbing me off, saying they are aware of high heart rate readings and updating software/algorithms to correct the issue, which never seems to happen.
As for the rest of the data the ring provides, the sleep figures can be way off as well, which is the only other metric I can verify. And as I've got no way of checking the rest of the data, I've got no way of confirming how accurate it is.
RingConn keep updating the design of the app, which is pointless if the data it shows isn't accurate.
Basically, don't buy a RingConn ring, it'll be money wasted.",1,2023-12-23T05:19:41.000Z,

It has the step accuracy of fitbit, Oura is not even close to being an accurate step counter. This ring automatically recognizes exercise and then rates the level of exercise accurately! Plus, you can't just add a workout and cheat this setup, it knows when your working out. With fitbit or Oura you can manually add the workout which then inflates your heart rate and gives you workout credit whether you actually worked out or not?? Oura is slow to recognize stress, this ring is spot on all the time! This is the only ring that gives you 24hr automatic heart rate, spo2 and hrv readings all the time that is super accurate and then gives you an ongoing average all day and night of those metrics! Come on everyone, please realize your HRV is the epicenter of all of your workout or just normal recovery from anything your doing! This ring nails it even when compared to my chest strap that measures my HRV and I can see it at a glance anytime, wherever I am! The information pages are like no other app with ongoing averages to all your other metrics and a trend format like no other. I am surprised there is no monthly charge for this app. I bought the silver and it is a beautiful ring, matte finish in the center to a polished surface on the edges, very durable too.

Very Dissatisfied Customer,"I ordered a ring from RingConn after researching many different ones. I did not pick the ""I don't know my size"" as I have a ring sizer at home and I know my ring size. However, once I received my ring and wore it for 3 days my 2nd knuckle on my pointer finger was sore and bruised; however the ring itself fit. I have long skinny fingers so the width of the ring takes up the entire area from the end of my finger where it touches my hand to the 2nd knuckle (I ordered the ring to fit both index fingers along with both pointer fingers). I have 2 autoimmune disorders that affect my joints and cause pain so sometimes I am unsure how something with affect my skin, joints, and be comfortable for me until I get and wear it. This happened once I wore the ring. I emailed the RingConn less than a week of receiving and wearing the ring explaining the situation and was told my circumstance does not allow for returns and I could either continue to wear it (even though I told them it is painful and causing bruises) or I could gift it to someone. So, I am now going to be out the money the ring cost along with having to purchase another tracker of some kind. I received absolutely no assistance from the company whatsoever. I do understand that I chose the the ring size and like I said it does fit but there are things that I cannot always plan for with having autoimmune disorders which is partly the reason why I chose their product as it would track some health measures I needed and wanted.",1,2023-11-06T21:05:33.000Z,

Very Satisfied User,"I have been using my RingConn for about a month now and it has been very helpful in monitoring my health. I purchased it specifically for the sleep tracking since I can’t stand to wear my bulky Apple Watch to sleep. The sleep tracking data is very thorough and complete and gives a score every night on the quality of your sleep which I find helpful at a glance to see how it went. As far as the fitness tracking and heart rate I wear both ring and watch during the day and both get the same (or very similar) results so I believe that the fitness data the ring collects is pretty accurate. I have a friend with the Oura ring and have compared data with them and the RingConn records the same data without the need for a paid subscription which is a great feature. Also I think that the RingConn’s detailed sleep data is more inclusive than what the Oura is able to provide. Overall I’m very happy with my ring and I find it so easy to wear I forget it’s there!

Just an FYI the shipping takes a very long time to arrive but that’s ok I was able to communicate with support and was reassured that it was on the way and not lost.",5,2023-10-03T17:32:18.000Z,

Brilliant health monitoring device,"Have loved this ring from moment I started wearing it.
Love all the features, it's comfortable and gives me so much information.
Longest part of the process was receiving the sizing kit, but actusl ring arrived within a few days.
Started using it straight away. I have a Samsung phone and it has paired nicely. I have a Samsung smart watch and a Tag one and have to say the ring is hands down better!
There are no monthly fees like some others, which made me favour this particular one after a lot of research, and I'm glad I did. The app that links the ring to your phone is probably one of the best apps around, the battery is superb and my ring lasts almost a full week before I have to recharge it... then it fully recharges within about 1 hour in the lovely wee case it came in.
My daily summary gives me not only sleep and stress info by each hour but also gives me my activity and steps. It compares day to day for activity, stress, sleep, heart rate, and activity calories plus more.
I am a real tech gadget person and this genuinely is one of the best products around for monitoring your health.
I love this ring so much my wife will be getting one for Christmas 😀",5,2023-09-14T11:19:33.000Z,
Proud user of the RingConn,"I always wanted smart ring after I saw first products like Oura, but decided to wait some time until I find one which would meet all the criteria. RingConn did it! I already use it few days and I am impressed! But, I am not only impressed with the ring itself, but also with the community and the customer service. They reply within few hours and I appreciate the way how they do so. Last but not least I am also impressed with speediness of the updates and their activity on FB group.

Keep doing, I am proud owner of the product.",5,2023-09-07T14:55:53.000Z,
A challenger for Oura,"This ring is absolutely stunning 😍 I used to have an Oura but switched to a Ringconn. I don't regret this decision at all. - Monthly fee - Portable charging case - Heart rate and SpO2 24/7 (Oura, only at night time) - Stress level measuring - Sleep data is accurate. I didn't have Oura same time but i had AppleWatch7. Ringconn is much more accurate with sleep data and steps. Ringconn really listen clients. They are active in FB group. Whicht features we would like to have etc. ❤️ 10 / 10 🎯",5,2023-09-03T08:31:55.000Z,
The BEST health tracking ring,"This company shows searious business with not only producing a high quality health tracking ring WITHOUT subscription and they have the best, friendliest and fastest responding costumer service.
Not only is the CS fantastic, but the whole company is involved in the development and feedback from their costumers in the most positive way.

The ring have a exclusive, great design and doesn't only look good, if feels comfortable to wear.
And it's the only ring on the market that comes with a charging case that holds 18 charges to the ring. And the ring have a battery that lasts for 7 days. How about that ?

After ordering the ring you'll be sent a sizing kit so you can determin your size and color of choise and when RingConn gets your order the ring will be sent to you in a premium presentation box.

The app is very pedagogical built and holds a ton of information recived from the ring. It's very easy to read the info from a summary on the first page of the app before diving in to the details.

I recommend anyone to do business with this company and their Health Tracking Ring is an amazing product with a constant development.",5,2023-09-02T09:16:49.000Z,
Health tracking ring,"The thing I love most about my RingConn ring is that it doesn't look like a tech device, it simply looks good.
On top of that it's very light and I don't feel that it's on my finger. The brushed gold looks beautiful.

Great that there is no monthly fee to get access to your data.

The ring is water resistant and I don't have to worry washing hands, doing dishes, showering, swimming or jumping in sea.

The RingConn app is very intuitive to use. And the company is constantly working on new features to implement. They have made some changes to the app so it's more functional.

I love the activity/daily calories & step count. It helps to see how active you need to be to maintain or lose weight.
The sleep tracking is very accurate and so is the heartrate and stress score tracking. (Compared to other wearables and medical equipement)
Bonus is the sleep temp.

The company is constantly updating the app and the RingConn firmware.
Making positive changes to help improve the product so it gets to be even better. They actually listen to their users. There have been several positive changes since I started using my ring about 4 months ago.

Great device for health tracking.",5,2023-09-01T13:16:34.000Z,
Heartrate monitoring Work perfect,"I do my morning run with the Ring and Garmin 965, the heart rate reading was identical , it surprise me a lot , wont expect this tiny ring can do....

RingConn ---- Well Done!!!",5,2023-08-30T06:11:51.000Z,
Ringconn rings are great,"I made a purchase in January of my very own ringconn ring. The app has been a great work in progress. We find a bug, they fix it. This is the first time a beta group has been so active. Now that the bugs have been worked out they just keep.maling improvements in the software. This wing has been great.

The astetics of the ring
The ring simply looks great. There is comfort and quality to put into the ring and makes me feel like they care about the product. They keep releasing the accessories and seem to put a lot of thought into them as well. I am so pleased with this product.

Cost.
At 279.00 it's a great deal. The other companies in the ring market are about the same price but don't offer the same matrix. They also (some) charge a monthly fee. The ringconn company has said a number of times they will not have a monthly fee, and they haven't.

I love my ring and am so happy I invested in it",5,2023-08-29T12:51:12.000Z,
Simply the best smart health device…,Simply the best smart health device that passively collects accurate results. I replaced my Apple Watch with the RingConn. I highly recommend it! It will take over Oura ring with confidence!,5,2023-08-29T05:06:35.000Z,
Have had the ring for a few months now…,"Have had the ring for a few months now and I love how detailed the app is. Tracking my sleep at night was one of the primary reasons I bought this in addition to no monthly fee like Oura has to use the product. I have noticed the ring often does not pick up naps automatically, but other then that I have no real complaints or issues. The support to date has been excellent from the Ringconn team- always friendly and helpful. This is a great product that should continue to get better with time and future software / firmware updates. Was somewhat skeptical buying this initially since there was no history to go on, but its proven to be a valuable everyday smart ring that I enjoy wearing daily.",4,2023-08-23T06:14:03.000Z,
Having ringconn is a plus,"I didn't got my ring yet but I like all the features that come in. I have my apple watch that works as a health tracker that measure heart rate, oxygen saturation and sleep stages but I need a different health tracker such as ringconn that can give me more details with scoring system on all vitals that will help to improve my health with exercise, sleeping and more. I would like to see in the future update the temperature sensor working as well. I also would like to see electrodermal sensor that can help in measuring the anxiety level in addition to the heart rate variability. It will also be beneficial to have fall detection, detection of heart attack or Afib, haptic alarm and may be blood pressure sensor. Thank you to ringconn team",5,2023-08-23T03:37:40.000Z,
"Do not buy, scam, no support","They don’t use US size rings. But they don’t say so anywhere except on the return page.

I got conned by RingConn,"I got conned by RingConn. The Heart Rate data is inaccurate, it never measures high intensity exercise. I've called, emailed, and submitted feedback through their app, the customer support team is giving me the full run-around, refusing to take accountability for their faulty product, and refusing to take my product back for a refund / return. Do not buy!",1,2023-08-16T20:16:43.000Z,
Phantastic,"Well, I am an early supporter of the idea, loving that subscription free solution.

I am usually wearing mechanical watches only, thus the ring supposed to be my device.

Update: the ring came right before the holiday season and is now in constant use, on the beach (salty atlantico), sweet water pool and on all other occasions.

I have been a bit skeptical lately after seeing the offer of a silicon protection cover; that maybe sand could damage the surface, scratching and so on.

Well, I have ordered the protecting ring but so far I don't have any complaints, even though the ring faces tough conditions, heat, sun, salt water etc..

I am very happy about the data the ring provides, data enabling me to have objective insights into (body/health) facts instead of feelings.

Beside the insights (and data means power in regard to our core asset, life), the ring looks stunning and can be worn without having a smartphone nearby as data will be synced later on.

Well, that's one of the best purchases I have ever made and it's going to boost knowledge about my body and supports me on my way to take even better care of myself, for me and my loved once.

Thumbs up.",5,2023-08-30T15:36:19.000Z,
Two time loser,"This is my second go-round with RingConn. I was in the original backer group, waited months and months, then finally got my ring. I was delighted because the app was so good, but it stopped pairing after two days and wouldn't power up at all. I sent it back. Months later, the replacement arrived and the same thing happened. Two days of wearing it and it stopped pairing, then refused to power up. These rings come from China, so who knows what's going on. All I know is that I am out a couple hundred bucks for a ring that's more or less bricked.",1,2023-08-11T03:58:08.000Z,
The ring arrived faulty,"The ring arrived faulty, contacted customer services a number of times to try and resolve it. They have stopped responding and have to go through the bank to get a chargeback. Shaddy company, avoid!!!!",1,2023-08-10T12:11:40.000Z,
Finally a serious contender in the health ring arena,"I just received my order of a gorgeous black RingConn and I have to say how impressed I am with the quality of work that has gone into creating this ring. From its packaging to functionality, fit and esthetics, this health tracking ring beats the front runner in this field, hands down. For example it can measure blood SpO2 saturation index continuously 24/7, something that even the Oura ring can not do without draining the battery and talk about battery, I just LOVE the charging box that comes with it, a subtle (and functional) addition that no other similar smart ring, has. The ring charges from almost no charge, within an hour or so and the charge lasts for a good 6-7 days.
The app is also a work of art and packed with live and historical health data and other information. You can just tell that a massive amount of work has gone into creating RingConn app alone.
RingConn also has built in temperature sensors and will soon activate the feature with an app update to measure core body temperature too. It currently only measures ""Skin Temperature""during sleep, and again another feature that Oura doesn't have.
As for accuracy, I have checked the SpO2 and Sleep data against my medical grade Oximeter and my ZEO EKG device. The results are within 2% of each other. In contrast my Oura Ring results are within a 6% margin of error which makes the RingConn an undisputed winner in accuracy, as far as I am concerned.
I would definitely recommend it.",5,2023-08-21T05:05:54.000Z,

Worked well,"RingConn smart ring provides comprehensive and detailed health tracking without any subscription fees. I have been using it for over 5 months, and each update has enhanced the overall experience. The sleep tracking feature is particularly impressive, as it provides insights into my sleep score factors, allowing me to make improvements to my sleep patterns. The heart rate and step count measurements are also accurate. I would gladly recommend this smart ring to my friends. Great job!",5,2023-06-20T08:19:52.000Z,
I was in the original purchase group of…,"I was in the original purchase group of RingConn. My first experiences with the ring were fantastic, much better than Oura. The HRV was all day and not just during sleep and it was accurate. The step counter was also accurate. The heart rate was not only accurate but continuous.

Then the ring simply stopped working. One night I woke up and there was no sleep data and no HRV data. This happened multiple times. I wrote to the company and received back a message obviously written by somebody who didn't speak English very well. Because I've had the ring for a few months, I cannot get my money back. So I put the Oura ring back on my finger and chalked this up to the normal fraud mongers who are out there looking to take our money.

Caveat emptor: Be careful of this company. Once a tracking device misses one day there is never a reason to wear it again. This ring has possibilities but isn't ready for prime time. Expect it to stop working and then expect customer service to write you back and talk to you like English is their sixth language.",2,2023-06-18T00:16:24.000Z,
Great Smart Ring and Health Tracker,"I backed this company on Indiegogo and I have to say that both the hardware and app is very impressive.

The ring is of a high quality and the app is user friendly. Communication has been top notch from RingConn through the whole process and still is, via email, the in-app feedback form and in the Facebook group, where they are very involved in conversations and listen to suggestions.

I have only had my ring for 3 days so far and still going on the first charge, but data seems accurate and the user experience really great.",5,2023-05-19T12:30:01.000Z,
A great ring - no subscription - great price,"I’ve had the ring for couple months now and really love it, so easy to use and the app is brilliantly easy to use
The main things I love is Heart-rate, oxygen levels, HRV, and sleep data,and walking I find all these neat correct to my other devices I use to check my health
I had the Oura ring but, not happy with it plus the subscription put me off even more
Since having the ring I’ve found the service from RingConn to be brilliant, they answer you in feedback in the app by email, and mr Dylan answers questions on the group, ive read here that group is toxic, I’ve only found it to be really helpful, someone in it will always try and help, with questions,
The app is really developing and now night time temperature working thats brilliant
Overall I love this ring I don’t need my watch at night, it lasts 6-7 days on one charge, it has a charging case with 18 charges in it so no wires required
Keep up the great work RingConn you should be proud to produce a brilliant ring that I love",5,2023-05-05T20:25:24.000Z,
RingConn is much better than Oura,"I have been wearing RingConn for a week now. I really like this!

I had Oura before. I have to admit that Oura is good for sleep tracking but 7$ in a month for subscription fee is too much. As a matter of principle i unsubscribed and i also sold my Oura.

I can compare RingConn sleep tracking to my Apple watch. I have to say that i believe RingConn more than Apple watch.

RingConn steps calcularor is working too. You can see walking distance. Oura’s steps wasnt working. I also like RingConn’s stress monitoring and also all the other features too. I dont miss Oura at all.

Some users complaining about scratches. Well… my Oura got so scratched that they changed my ring (warranty). Of course these can get scratches in hard use like phones watches etc. You can use wrap paper or something if you like to cover your ring.

Somebody said that Facebook admin and community are toxic. Well.. my experience is the opposite. Community helps each other and admins are there too. They also help people with their problems. I sent email to RingConn and they replied at the same day.

Overall:
I really recommend RingConn. Better looking than Oura. These guys updating app/ring and i have a feeling that they take this project seriously. Even more features than Oura (example stress monitoring). No monthly subscription fee and also RingConn is cheaper than Oura.",5,2023-04-27T23:14:36.000Z,
Not accurate. Toxic Community. Censorship!,"I compared the ring with multiple other trackers like Oura, Polar, Xiaomi, Whoop and a medical grade SpO2 sensor.
Sleep, SpO2 and HRV are completely off.
When trying to post friendly about my problems on the Facebook group, they got deleted.
The community and admin is toxic, like other users posted here. Support is not helping. Any negative comment gets you ridiculed and when you response you get kicked out. Censorship is very high and maintained trough several user profiles.

Very Pleased!,"I was one of the first 20 backers of this IndieGoGo kickstarter campaign and have no regrets whatsoever. Received my sizing kit and ultimately my ring in the timeframe promised by RingConn. This company is EXTREMELY proactive and the communication with their backers has been EXTRAORDINARY.

The app software and ring firmware are works in progress, however, I’m not a fussy person as I see RingConn putting a lot of time and effort into development.

Sadly, the negative reviews on here are ridiculous at best with RingConn not deserving the negativity as they’ve been ALWAYS upfront and transparent with their backer unlike any other kickstarter campaign I know of.

My experience has been positive and some of the data has been extremely accurate but also know with this first generation ring that it will get better over time. What people need to know is smartwatches and smart rings are NOT medical devices but are excellent for baseline numbers only.",5,2023-04-15T17:56:48.000Z,
Really an amazing wearable health device,"From the moment I got this amazing ring I have loved it. Right now I struggle with stress and sleep, so I decided on this ring. I have an Apple watch but it does not give me as much information as this ring. There are no monthly fees like some those other rings have. The app that links the ring to your phone is probably one of the best apps around. My ring lasts almost a full week before I have to recharge it. And it only takes about an hour to get it fully recharged. I received my ring in February so I have been wearing it every day since. Honestly, I don't even wear my Apple watch anymore since I got this ring. It gives me so much info on the times in the day my stress level rises so I can try to control those times better. I really like all of the information it gives me about what my heart and breath rhythms are doing throughout the night. My daily summary gives me not only my sleep and stress info by each hour in also gives me my activity and steps. It compares my day to day for activity, stress, sleep, heart rate, and activity calories plus more. This is really one of the best products around for monitoring your health.

Best smart ring on the market!!,"This ring works, unlike some others out there. RingConn came to crowdfunding ready to deliver and they have. I had another ring briefly and despite being a market leader, I had horrible customer service from them and had to send that ring back.
This ring is absolutely amazing. Yes it's a startup company, yes this is the first generation ring, but this is by far the most responsive company I have ever seen.
They're just they're not just shipping any old thing like some are, they are shipping live working rings, and they are working every day to make them better.
We've had software updates, we've had firmware updates, they have multiple channels for people who've received their rings already to submit issues and they're working on them and fixing them and they're putting serious effort into making this the best smart ring out there. If I had gotten a tenth of this support from that other company, I might still have that ring.
I thought smart rings were a great idea from when I first heard of them, I can't wear the watches comfortably because my wrists are too small, and I'm absolutely thrilled with this product. It is lightweight, and fits well And it does a great job of what it's supposed to. Someone else has posted on here all the things it does, so I'm not going to list them again, and I'll admit all of the readings are not 100% perfect yet, but since I've had mine, I've seen it get better and better and better. I keep thinking I want to get one from another company just to be able to compare them, but so far, there's no one out there that even comes close to being worth bothering with.
If you're thinking of getting a smart ring, this is the one. This ring is actually in production, and being shipped. It is not a pie in the sky fantasy like some of the other ones being sold are and there's no monthly subscription fee, so they're not trying to do a money grab. These rings are being shipped, and they are working.",5,2023-03-29T06:18:56.000Z,
The company says they are in Delaware…,"The company says they are in Delaware United states they are not.

I ordered in December of 2022, at the time. They said they are in production mode with local delivery in February.

In January the sizing kit arrived, and that apparently fulfilled the pledge. Ring has not yet shipped, and they have said, we meant to say shipping starts after Feb.

Of the 7100 backers from Dec around 900 have received rings.

The rest get to run around the company is actually out of china. They are currently under investigation from Indegogo for violation of crowdfunding rules.

They are extremely aggressive at removing all negative reviews on social media. Anyone says anything negative or complains about the ring. Gets the post deleted as hate speech.

They have now said they will ship another 1500 sometime in the next few weeks (maybe)

They say so many contradicting things its incredible.

So far most people getting black rings.. are showing they are easily scratched.

Sleep data is way off, and seams to be generic. A few users posted screen shots. Showing they had the exact same sleep data.

Issues reported with steps.

They advertise they do body temp, but now say its not actually enabled at this time. And will be at a later date.

But is still listed as a feature.

I would avoid this Chinese company that is pretending to be a US company at all costs.",1,2023-03-25T14:54:45.000Z,

But from purchasing the product they stated deliveries estimated Feb/March 2023 if I remember rightly
They gave lots of updates and within a month I received my sizing ring December 2022 and the Ring in February 6 2023
Wow what a piece of technology well worth the money it does exactly same as the Oura ring but no subscription.
They say 7 day battery life had it on for 7 days and still 19% battery and took 1 hour to recharge to 100% so really impressed , also it has portable charging case good for vacations. I
The company have been very good on answering any questions on messenger
All readings on the app are quite good couple small glitches but there ironing them out,
I have compared it to my Apple Watch and very similar only this does a great deal more
On the ring the sizing kit I picked size 12 and when the ring come size 12 it was actually comfier than the sizing ring.
If anyone thinking of getting a smart ring I highly recommend this one absolutely love it even picks up when I have a nap
