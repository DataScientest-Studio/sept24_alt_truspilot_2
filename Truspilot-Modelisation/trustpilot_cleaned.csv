"great ring overall just needs some improvements in monitoring workouts this has been a great smart ring the price is right and i love that the app and plethora of data are both free the first ring i received was not tracking vitals properly but ringconn was responsive and sent a replacement ring it did take a couple of weeks this ring has been consistently tracking data and i love how many graphs are provided for interpretation it seems to do a good job with step tracking at least for trends but it struggles to accurately monitor my heart rate during rowing workouts i have automatic workout mode detection on and even set it to an indoor cycling workout but my heart rate is rarely registers above bpm it does much better during running workouts women s health cycle tracking was one of my main reasons for purchasing it s very simple but temperature shifts was all i needed so this does the job just fine overall i would definitely recommend the ring","4"

"not disability immobility friendly yet your ring does not in any way cater for disabled or chronically ill people which is surprising when it is said to be medically approved i d have thought it would be designed with those people in mind alas i am bed and wheelchair bound but get asked to get up out of my sedentary position constantly all day long i find it extremely offensive and frustrating that i can t turn this off despite not having the exercise options on it thinks i m taking steps when it s been over a dozen years when i took any please please update this even the apple watch has a wheelchair user option to recognise if a person does not have the ability to be mobile as for the other features they are great but an alert on your phone app for extremely abnormal o sats or hr would be much more useful than having to look it up after the fact","3"

"love the fit love the fit the size isn t too intrusive it s much lighter than i thought it would be feels cheap but i like that it s not heavy because i can t even tell i have it on i gave it stars because it doesn t track any exercises that i do it only does indoor outdoor walking running and cycling i do weightlifting volleyball yoga boxing etc it s totally my fault for not doing more research i really like everything else about it if it tracked more exercises then it would be a star the cycle tracking and the sleep tracking i like it might over count my steps though my apple watch always has a couple thousand less steps than the ring so i don t really trust that and i go above and beyond my step goal","3"

"theres nothing smart about it review for ringconn gen overall really disappointed in this product i honestly want to return it but one it will cost me to ship it back and two i dont have time to deal with that right now its basically a wearable ring health tracker theres nothing smart about it it only writes data it doesnt read meaning that it can only go off its own data i wish i did more research and got something with more integration ai habits and insights the main reason i chose this ring was for the sleep apnea and o tracking which im not even happy with only positive i have is the battery life negatives you can tell from its language that it was manufactured in china iv had issues with the o not reading correctly which is the primary reason i got it i also got it specifically for the sleep apnea tracking but what i didnt find out till i got it is that you have to turn on that setting for it to work its not tracking everyday on its own also it says that it consumes more battery life as well i get warnings for outliers in my heart rate and hrv all the time but its mostly because my schedule varies so much also considers my panic attacks as moderate to high intensity activity exercise mode even when heart rate is unusually high and theres little to no movement i also hate how they have ads on facebook that you can wear it while swimming and in the sauna but when you read about the ring in the app it specifically says you shouldnt wear it in the sauna those are all the issues i can think of off hand but im sure theres more overall my suggestion is do your research theres better options than this","1"

"great alternative to smart watch for biometrics ringconn good product the app covers all the biometrics comprehensively information is displayed well and has both i explanations and break out boxes with more detail previous daily data is a matter of swiping right and left to come back judging from the calendar drop down this will probably include daily data for as long as you keep it longer term trends are also available from a different tab the ring is easy to wear remarkably lightweight and looks good the ring s durability has yet to be fully tested but has survived a fair amount of basic tool use and gardening so far i don t avoid getting it wet with the exception that i avoid putting it in hot water dishes showers etc there s always minor issues that may be in development or just personal preferences nothing at all show stopping though audience for the following is more for the developers y axis of graphs varies across days making visual comparisons inconclusive there could be user defined ranges or ranges could be re aligned automatically when required these could be toggled on off x axis includes multiple data points per column a single column contains low medium high vigorous this could be a minute by minute line showing the fluctuations again this could be toggled on off sleep value went down after unusually large amounts of sleep makes sense something is wrong but app says slow down so is only looking at final score not gross value of sleep also records sleep while i m screen reading books the stress indicator appears remarkably inaccurate i don t know enough to make suggestions but it is an area that would likely benefit from some more research data doesn t update without an internet connection surely the base calculations are simple enough to process on device there are times when it quite difficult to obtain internet on a regular basis some of those points would be concessions to battery life and battery life was a primary consideration of purchase","5"

"i am on about week of using the ring i am on about week of using the ring and am loving it it is easy to use and i m amazed at the amount of information that it is able to track so far my only suggestion is that it would be helpful if there were a marking on the outside of the ring either top or bottom to show when the two inside pins are properly positioned in dim or dark situations it is often difficult for me to tell if the ring is properly positioned the main reason i got the ring was to monitor my spo which for unknown reasons had been dropping precipitously during the day and i needed to be able to track it in real time i find the ring to be more accurate than the finger oximeter","5"

"ringconn air i own both ringconn models my wife liked and kept my first purchase which was for my pinky finger so now i have purchased an air for myself i can t see any difference in weight or size between the two models the specs indicate the air has slightly shorter battery life and is made of stainless steel the included charger is smaller but it doesn t include a battery like the standard model i guess that s how they reduced the price personally i like the smaller charger and i don t mind charging it once a week i do wish the gold color choice was available for the air model now to the app it doesn t have all the health metrics that the apple watch has but for what it does measure the ring and watch are in close agreement the ringconn app is easier to read at a glance and also easier to navigate drilling down the detail is sensibly displayed using easy to understand graphs and charts finally there is no monthly fee overall i think this is a great product it does what it does exceptionally well and at a value price","5"
"great product data and app i love the ring it s comfortable to wear and the data and app are great i also really appreciate the no subscription model compared to other comparable products it s the main reason why i chose ringconn only one criticism at purchase it wasn t apparent that a charging dock was included in the price so i purchased a second one that i don t need","5"

"ringconn gen review from ringconn gen review a sleek alternative to the smartwatch i ve been using the ringconn gen for about three weeks now and i have to say i m genuinely impressed customer support that delivers my experience started on a positive note even before the ring arrived i accidentally ordered the wrong size but after contacting customer support they quickly and efficiently arranged for the correct size to be shipped instead the entire process was smooth and i received the perfectly fitting ring without any issues a small device with big capabilities what really surprised me was how advanced this little ring is when it comes to tracking health data it captures a wide range of metrics throughout the day with impressive accuracy as someone who has used smartwatches in the past i d say the ringconn is a compelling alternative especially for those looking for something more discreet and lightweight whether you re monitoring workouts sleep or vital signs the ring delivers solid insights that said during strength training or any activity involving weights i d recommend using finger tape to avoid potential scratches comfort fit i m not someone who normally wears rings but i quickly got used to this one it feels natural on the finger and doesn t shift or feel loose even during runs or fast sudden movements i never once felt like it might fall off final thoughts sizing tip the ringconn gen combines style comfort and functionality in a surprisingly compact form for anyone looking to track their health without the bulk of a smartwatch this ring is absolutely worth considering my recommendation for sizing i suggest choosing a comfortable size for your index finger that also fits snugly on your middle finger and slightly looser on your ring finger this gives you flexibility and ensures the ring stays comfortable throughout the day no matter which finger you wear it on","5"

"love the ringconn i love the ringconn i got my husband and myself the ringconn gen because of the longer battery life and the sleep apnea monitoring the measurements it gets is accurate and the fact that you don t have to pay for a subscription is amazing and the primary reason we didn t get an oura ring the ringconns are super light feeling and it s nice that you can sync it to apple health and the android health too the only comments i have are that i wish the app has an option to put in health issues that affect your vitals and that the sizing rings versus the ringconn feel slightly different the ringconn feels a couple of millimeters larger than the practice one so we just bought spacers to help the sizing which worked but it s overall great would highly recommend in fact i ve been telling so many of my coworkers and friends about it haha","5"

"the sizing kit and the actual ring size are different the sizing kit and the actual ring size are different i had to ask for a exchange since the ring i got was loos so i went from size from sizing kit to in actual ring the shipping from hong kong to canada takes way too long it would be much better to ship from usa to canada the data and analytics in the app are quite basic the ai feature and goal plans could be utilized more to make the ring better the other use of the ring could be in the gym i need to track my heart rate while working out but the ring takes data in certain intervals so i wish there was a feature to track heart rate constantly while working out like the apple watch does","3"

"data accuracy the data provided by the ring in many cases is totally inaccurate in particular the sleep analysis can be way off for instance it records me in deep sleep sometimes while sitting reading or on my phone prior to bed therefore lying still in bed prior to falling asleep can be recorded totally wrong total sleep time and stages are generally not useful some other data like heartbeat may be much better","2"

"more good than bad pros lightweight attractive well built comfortable to wear user friendly interface with easily understood and accessible data gui not gimmicky sleep apnea evaluation option fast response from customer service to questions outstanding battery life with fast recharge cons simply not dependable as a step counting activity tracker for instance mowing on a riding lawn tractor for a few hours results in steps counted per customer service certain devices may misinterpret some arm movements as walking leading to an overestimation also the ring estimates step count based on accelerometer data and other sensor inputs therefore in daily life certain movements such as unconscious actions caused by ankle pain or hand movements while sitting may sometimes be misinterpreted as steps leading to an overestimation of step count so steps counted while seated no sh t sherlock less than useful advice like the rem state still has room for improvement without further recommendations overall while the device provides a wealth of data much of that data and evaluation seems integrated into questionable accelerometer data so the balance of the data feels less reliable than i had expected however i believe this is a common problem with ring type trackers and not unique to ringconn","4"

"ringe size change ringconn gen i had to change my ringconn gen mate black size to size and had a good customer experience with the ringconn support team in changing the ring size against a little fee i think the difference to the the size kit is also quite strong related to the swelling in cold and warm weather also the swelling in the night for example with ring size i can use it in the night an the left indexfinger and in daytime on the right index finger while with size i can wear in the night at the right index finger but in daytime i m losing it from both index fingers regarding functionality i m quite happy regarding walking steps it seems to overestimate in comparison to my garmin fenix watch i very happy with sleep recording and sleep apnoe screening the app is fine but the apps from other smart rings are a little nicer regarding design and overview charts","5"

"general use this ring is awesome compared to one of your competitors i like the fact that you get more than days of charging and when you do need a charge a friendly reminder notifies you to do so with plenty of time still on a charge no subscription is need too only drawback would be the limited amount of sports you can choose from under the exercise tab if they would add tennis or pickleball to the list that would be helpful","5"

"buying and using the ringconn key points pros great service smooth buying experience and love the product sleep tracking is excellent for women cycle tracking aspect is intuitive and un intrusive cons only registers running and cycling as exercises no manual entry for other forms of exercise or times when you can t wear it i backed the ringconn in its kickstarter campaign the whole process was smooth and hassle free i got my sizing kit fairly quickly and wore a few different sizes to see what felt right i found it very difficult to select the right size but eventually settled on one when the time came i selected my colour and size and sat back and waited for my order to be shipped once i got it i discovered that the fit was not as i expected but enough larger than the demo sizer to not fit me properly so i requested a size exchange this went through without a hitch and i absolutely love my ringconn ring it tracks my sleep very well which is the main reason i got it and all my other bios the one and only nit that i would pick would be that you can t enter manual exercise entries and the ring only records running cycling this means that the fitness classes that i do where i can t wear the ring don t get recognised as active activity times also it doesn t register any of the fitness classes i do as exercise and if it s a low no impact class that doesn t register any steps but does raise the heartrate the app registers my exercise as moderate stress this is not enough of an issue to impact my satisfaction with the ring and the process of buying it online the cycle tracking is fairly basic but pretty easy to use and easy enough to modify if needed the interface is intuitive and un intrusive","5"

"really impressed really impressed ringconn is serious in improving and the measurements are more and more accurate what i get now for steps hearth rate stress sleep is pretty similar to my smartwatch good quality though after few months the black paint is slowly fading on the bottom which gets frequent bumps very happy with purchase even though i consider smart rings to be way too expensive i bought to get better insight on my sleep because watch is too bulky for sleep","5"

"great product outstanding customer service i discovered the ringconn through kickstarter and purchased it as a super early bird right from the start the ring met my expectations and with each update the app improved even further unfortunately over new year s i experienced a significant decline in battery performance since battery wear and tear is excluded from the warranty i reached out to customer service their support was excellent they provided multiple solutions and i even kept a log to help diagnose the issue what can i say my ring was replaced without any hassle the customer service was always courteous and helpful i can wholeheartedly recommend both the product and the support team","5"

"best smartring i ve had this ring for two or three months now and i ve been wearing it almost every day and i love it i found the sizing to be pretty accurate to the kit that they offer with the gold finish beware that the palm side of the ring will scratch if you re using it to work out with dumbbells etc however this is expected and the most visible parts of the ring hold up very well to every day wear and tear i love the app and how easily accessible everything is and the battery life of the ring is exceptional it really does last around days on a full charge i bought this ring because i didn t like the sporty look of most smart watches as i typically have to wear business professional clothing both me and my friend whom i recommended the ring to love this wearable technology and let s not forget that you don t have to pay to use the ringconn app","5"

"great health monitor the ring was slow to ship but it has been worth the wait i love the detailed information and functionality provided in the app all without a monthly subscription the sleep apnea monitoring is a big part of why i waited to puchase a higher end health monitor it appears accurate the readings are even a little higher than what my cpap machine reads the only thing lacking is it s ability to pick up naps but at least they can be manually added additional exercise options would be nice too i don t actually use that feature because nothing matches what i usually do","4"

"sort of good i bought the ring with the hope of replacing a monitoring band for sleep and stress tracking the experience has been ok ish it tracks your pulse and blood oxigen quite accurately also stress during the day is pretty accurate when it comes to sleep tracking that s where things take a turn for the worse while it is quite good in identifying when you go to sleep it makes the difference between sleeping and just lying on the couch watching a movie the actual sleep parameters i find are quite off you generally wake up to a sleep score of over even on bad nights hrv during the night for me was quite unchanged whether i had a relaxation day or an intense workout day with lots of work besides it it generally overshoots both rem and deep sleep undershooting awake time activity tracking is limited to walking running and biking and only if location is turned on this last part for me was enough reason to not use it as an activity tracker on the plus side support is really fast on answering questions and addressing problems however i do not know how much of the feedback they use for improvement there is lots of potential in this ring but some of the aspects really need atention","3"
"great response to suggestions and improvement request feedback product worked very well i wear it all the time except when charging excellent response for improved sp calibration in comparison to my fda approved medical device i was so happy with it i gave the first one to my son i bought it as soon as it was available and upgraded to the newest version well worth the money","5"

"i really enjoy the ringconn i really enjoy the ringconn but after comparing it to the oura ring for over a month now the difference in sleep detection is way off most often it will be off by hours i do notice the heart rate is very close to the oura ring and apple watch it is almost spot on with my pulse ox just my biggest complaint is the sleep detection once i adjust the time manually the rem and deep sleep are about of the time very similar to the oura ring the one benefit of the ringconn though is the no subscription it is a one time buy and that s it for that i have to change my original rating of stars to stars","4"

"i just feel like this ring doesn t do i just feel like this ring doesn t do as much as i thought it tracks all the right things but doesn t always stay well connected to my phone which makes me question accuracy also a competitor has the option to be woken up when in light sleep rather than deep sleep and if that could be in the next update that would be huge for me i would be open to more notifications too because i feel like i ve only gotten them when the battery was dying which also doesnt seem to last as long as i expected but i have only charged it once so far","2"
"the sleep tracking seems to be good and the sleep tracking seems to be good and the main reason i bought it it looks good also and is fairly scratch resistant the heart rate portion is absolutely horrendous i use a heart rate sensor when riding my bike and the ring is not even remotely close like bpm off when i m on my bike my ring thinks i need to move lol it makes me wonder how good anything it recommends could be when the heart rate which seems like a basic function is off so bad","3"

"great customer service date of experience january","5"
"my ring simply doesn t accurately track based on my experiences over the past two weeks of continuous use both during the day and at night i have some concerns about the ringconn s activity tracking accuracy specifically i ve noticed that the sleep tracking data appears to be significantly off for example on the first two nights despite getting nearly hours of sleep the app recorded only about half that duration i initially expected that ongoing use might help refine the sleep tracking algorithm but so far the nightly data has not improved for additional context i primarily wear the ring on my left index finger and occasionally on my middle finger where it fits perfectly as a comparison i monitored my sleep with an apple watch which consistently recorded around hours of sleep each night this contrast between the two devices leads me to question the overall reliability of the ringconn in tracking sleep and daily activity accurately","2"

"this ring is awsome this ring is awsome it gives informations not just about how many steps a day i make but also gives informations on sleep apnea mood stress etc it might not be exact on the steps i make depending on what i m doing but it makes me want to move walk exercise and that s good for my health and the charge last for at least days so i can wear it all day long i am really satisfied","5"
"pro and cons the sleep tracking is quite accurate and stable compared with many other trackers the heart rate monitor too the app is just right simple and not overwhelming it doesn t feel bulky wearing it the step tracking is actually very bad sometimes i get up in the morning i get to the kitchen and i have steps counted the exercises are very very limited there is nothing about anaerobic exercises such as bodyweight i hate the fact that i need the charger to exit airplane mode in it shouldn t be i can t wear it while welding which is a big part of my job and my phone drains the battery looking for the ring if i put it in airplane mode i need to bring the charger with me but most of smart ring wearers do it because of the very small size of it and if i need to bring the charger at work it loses part of the porpoise overall a great product","4"

"love this ring from a newbie smart ring owner ring is extremely well made with comfortable slim fit much less bulky than any other ring on the market fit is slightly different than sizing kit but this is most likely due to the smooth slick internal coating of the ring versus the plastic material of the sizer comfortable to wear all day and all night i find that the app is well made and although the app update changed the look of the main metrics page it is intuitive and appears pretty accurate particularly from a sleep tracking perspective and the sleep score is extremely helpful even when i get adequate or at least better length of sleep i can associate my quality of rest accurately with a good or bad sleep score nap auto detection is particularly impressive i only wish workout detection was automatic and there were more options for workout types","5"

"great ring but software could be improved i love my ringconn ring as i also own the gen oura ring i feel that i can provide a meaningful perspective pros ringconn has a slimmer profile longer battery life and best of all no monthly fee in addition i have a rare limitation in that the oura ring doesn t accurately read my heart rate while both gen and gen versions of the ringconn read my heart rate flawlessly cons where ringconn falls short is that some of the software aspects are not quite as good as oura for example oura has much better accuracy at reading when i m awake vs being asleep many times where the ringconn shows me sleeping the oura accurately recognized that i was awake and reading a book another area where ringconn falls short is that there is no integration with partner software so it doesn t recognize workouts i might have done that are recorded on strava and apple health the ringconn app is good with lots of useful information i find that the ai aspect is not very useful and gets in the way of just looking at the data in contrast oura has a slightly more meaningful ui that makes it easier to understand the data presented overall i can recommend the ringconn it s solid reliable and the lack of a monthly membership fee is a welcome benefit","4"

"couldn t be happier after a lot of research i chose the ringconn gen and am so happy i did love love love that no subscription is required to get all the data steps don t match my smart watch but have always questioned its accuracy and think the ring is probably more accurate got it mainly to track sleep and find it very comfortable to wear played around with the sizing kit to choose the best finger and size for comfort and am very pleased once size was submitted the ring arrived very quickly the app paired with my phone easily and is very easy to navigate love only having to charge weekly","5"

"ring that never arrived after making a purchase i ve been waiting over a month for a ring that never arrived supposedly sent on track has been lost on somewhere in holland ringconn didn t resolve it did not send another piece and could not even say when it would be sent i got the feeling that the company forced me to cancel as the price for the ring has been raised lately so it s better for ringconn to sell a piece for to another person instead of sending it to me as i took faith in the company and made a preorder so i ve cancelled the order and now i am waiting for my money to be returned contact is artificial and lacks real information very bad experience i cannot recommend buying from ringconn from anyone from my friend unless they surprise me by something in the end","1"

"great experience overall except for few great experience overall except for few things ring is comfortable but the lack of mid sizes with increments is an issue people genuinely between and for example or struggle with the sizing price is really high for the apps limited offerings and the sleep data is not accurate sometimes and needs a way to edit it in detail not all of it at once that s a huge issue that affects overall trends in my opinion overall like the ring battery is great outside of it is matte which i love but looks plastic to others lol most importantly reason i bought it no subscription if that stays i keep using it that s what helps this company overtake the main leading one in the industry","4"

"awesome ring this ring packs a powerful punch so don t let the size fool you i bought a lot of smart rings to test a lot of them out and this one by far is the best in the market first thing is i like that it s thin because that makes a huge difference since some of them are just so thick it s uncomfortable to work with battery life is exactly what they state it lasts just about two weeks or so other rings if they re constantly running in the background like measuring heart rate or pulse ox for example it drains the battery like crazy but this ring does not to me there s no point of wearing a smart ring if it s not going to constantly measure the details without dying so quick the price of the ring to me is pretty fair considering what you re expecting to work out of a good item the saying you buy cheap you get cheap is exactly the case with all these smart rings and the material they make this out of does not damage easily at all which is another big plus for me if you are rough the measurements are very accurate because i put it to the test since i work in the medical field it makes it a little bit easier to measure things so overall this is an excellent ring to keep track of things if you don t always want to use your apple watch or any smart watch for that matter i have used this for a few months now so i can accurately measure if it lives up to the expectations the only thing i hope that they add in the next software update would just be to measure blood pressure since all the other smart rings do that and for this one measuring everything under the sun they just didn t add blood pressure check so i hope to see that shortly but looking forward to the third generation whenever it comes out","5"
"i like all the options to see how many i like all the options to see how many steps and how well i slept and all of the features this ring had would be nice if there was an option to get the rings in half sizes also i have a size ring and is about a half size to big probably could use a","4"

"inaccurate data have had the smart ring ringconn for about months my first impression is that the ring is well made and seems to have some sophisticated technology simply put the functions as indicated on the ring main screen are sleep stress activity and heart rate it provides a lot of data on each function personally i find the data almost overwhelming and squeezed together what i have found in my brief time with the ring is that under activity steps is that they are inaccurate i have a pedometer and an apple watch and they both record similar readings in steps taken also the ring does not provide distance for the steps if you know how many steps you should know the approximate distance the ringconn is way off on average steps this is unacceptable and i would think skews the data on other applications on the ring the heart rate bpm is also suspect during activity no clear way to test except by my watch and that indicates a discrepancy i am disappointed that the ring does not capture the most basis function of exercise steps in an accurate manner and heart rate i did contact ringconn about the steps issue and got a response promptly but the answer was sort of undefined and in no way an answer to solving the issue i have reset the ring several times but that did not change the accuracy of the steps i will try it for a little while longer then i will have chalk this up to some devices are not up to the task i would not buy this ring if you expect it to record the basic function of tracking your exercise steps or even distance and perhaps heart rate during activity dm","2"

"good gadget to track your sleep the ring looks pretty good obv not as good as a accessory ring the appdesign is good and easy to understand it monitors sleep hr and spo very well the hrv can only be measured precisely if ur hand is not moving accordingly i don t know how much you can put on the stress index which the ring calculates based on the hrv which can t be recorded accurately during the day with all the movement the ring also overestimates the amount of steps taken which is shown by the difference in steps measured by my phone and by the ring also be aware that the ring of the sizing kit is i can only talk about my order a little smaller than the actual ring i bought the ring to monitor my sleep which is tracked very good but only stars due to sizing kit not being acurate and the hrv measuring as well as the overestimation of the steps which for me is not very relevant","4"

"i was recommended ring type health from my chiropractor i was recommended a ring type health device from my chiropracticor she has the oura ring and has consistently showed me her data and differences when we compare i prefer the ringconn because of the value fit and also i appreciate the data i think the data user face and the notifications can be improved it is a tad bit cumbersome to navigate and the data while interesting isn t as informative with suggestions ideas to progress improve and variable options suggestions of how to improve and why while i fully understand this is not necessarily a health product that supplements professional advice etc i think the ringconn does have room for improvement in this area particularly for those of various levels of fitness age and interest in health whether light go with the flow or aggressively trying to improve their health overall the look fit and battery life etc is wonderful context of the reviewer me i am years old moderately active played sports most my life generally relatively weekly active with hikes walks sports etc about wk or more looking forward to more future improvements thanks for an awesome product","4"

"bigger size please the ringcoon ring offers good quality and efficient battery management the accompanying app is straightforward which is beneficial as it covers all necessary functions without any unnecessary complexity however the widgets are redundant since they merely mirror the app s windows it s easier to open the app sync and check progress directly one drawback is the need to send data to the cloud for any results the phone or app should process basic data locally with cloud connectivity reserved for more detailed insights additionally push notifications for ring software updates would be helpful while frequent app usage might be encouraged for data collection a notification for updates would benefit standard or it users who sync less frequently moreover a larger size option would be awesome as even the size feels a bit small","4"

"still on the fence still on the fence look feel design of the ring and battery length is fabulous would highly recommend on these aspects alone however when it comes to obtaining the metrics and understanding how the insights are derived this ring leaves a lot to be desired i have had this for a couple of months now and was eager to have the oxygen and stress readings to keep track of some health issues sadly of the time the ring does not capture readings for many of the metrics and i still have no understanding of how any of the insights related to stress are gathered readings that are captured appear to be off as well for example stress readings and exercise mode just don t seem to be tracking correctly","2"

"excellent feedback tool robustness is something to be hoped useful information and potential benefits of the suggested behaviour changes based on personal data not sure about battery or long term the request for feedback was only months after use it s also unclear but most probably the data is shared with other entities ghere s no real choice everyone does it regardless of their operational place would i buy again ask me two years from jow","5"
"lacks functionality even with enabling persistent connection it will not stay connected you ve got to open the app every hour or you will not get any idle notifications or heart rate warnings the integration into google fit feels clunky that might be due to the changes google is making with health connect it would be great if there were third party apps like wellatory could use the data it gives great charts and data very well the ring is very comfortable for the most part i do not recommend trying to lift weights with it on though","3"

"good ring but inaccurate hr readings while training dit i got the ring shortly after writing the review below so far so good it is not very accurate for measuring the heart rate while training it consistently measures a heart rate that is much lower than reality vs bmp i wish it also measured the skin temperature but that seems to only work while sleeping for some reason for the delay they did send me the ring protectors to compensate but honestly i will never wear these protectors they are ugly and are a hassle to put on i would rather put a glove or take the ring off if i feel i could scratch it previous review i wish i could review the ring but yuntrack is so damn slow to deliver that i am still waiting for it weeks after ordering it the sizing kit took days to arrive and the ring looks like it will take days i mean at this price charge more and use a better delivery service that will actually get it to customers in a matter of days not weeks","4"

"in general i like the product in general i like the product i went through wellue rings before trying this it holds the charge as claimed which is amazing it charges in minutes or less as claimed also amazing the water resistant aspect is my most favorite part as i think i lost at least two of the previous brand because of that i love that it is not bulky and looks like normal jewelry i find most of the readings accurate when they are taken the things i would change if i could continuous readings for oxygen and heart rate for some of us that are chronically ill it is important to know in lass than minutes if our oxygen drops along those lines notifications when we have readings outside of certain settings these are huge and frankly i wouldn t have bought the ring if i had more clearly understood if it can send sedentary notifications it should be able to send others the sleep recording is way off i am chronically ill on really bad days i am sedentary for the better part of the day the ring records that as sleep and not just sleep but deep sleep and rem sleep this doesn t seem appropriate i think this is a great product and hopefully with some updates and tweaks along the way it will be an amazing product","3"

"good so far so far my ring has been very good the sizing and delivery was as advertised i am very pleased with that the ring case had a good charge when delivered and it did not take a lot of time to charge the ring it was easy to get everything installed updated and operating i put it into the case to charge when showering and it stays close to but some tweaks are still necessary the first day i cut the grass with a push mower this registered as taking a nap also i walk several km daily and the outdoor walking selection on the app is not yet active so my ring has yet to record any exercise it does count my steps a bit more freely than my phone pedometer app google fit records my route not the ring i have not had any updates since receiving my ring so i hope these anomalies are corrected my sleep and other reading appear accurate it is comfortable to wear i am quite happy with my ringconn and hope further updates can address some of the limitations and glitches i have noted","4"

"great upgrade to fitness watch the ring was easy to order and equip it tracks displays well and it is integrated with google fit it is an upgrade from the hassle of a fitness watch just a ring on a finger no half ring sizes impacts me hockey is not well tracked it seems the measurement intervals miss the highest heart rates or averages them with the heart rate during recovery between shifts","5"
"ringconn review what i like is the convenience put it on and forget about it being able to shower with it on is great stress and sleep measurements work well the wellness balance suggestions are helpful what i don t like is the heart rate and step counter measurements they both only work correctly when your arm is moving i work out on a stationary bike i also wear another heart rate monitor on my arm my other heart rate monitor will be reading for example however the ring thinks i m inactive because i have my arms on the handle bars not moving i also don t get any credit for steps because my arm is not moving so i don t get any credit for the whole workout if you walk or run for exercise the ring is great i also use a push mower to mow grass on a slopping lot it is a great workout but my heart rate according to the ring will stay around because my arms are on the mower handle not moving i also don t get any credit for steps for the same reason arms not moving if i take my arm off the bike or mower the heart rate and steps are correct mowing and biking one handed is difficult and not sustainable i do manage to reach my step goals but i have to do extra walking or running to achieve it i really do like the ring i hope a firmware update will fix these issues","3"

"ringconn has a long way to go to bring their customer service up to par so far the ring performs as advertised i wish i could give it a better rating but the issues i had with customer service overshadowed the experience in ways i won t soon forget my ring was lost in shipping and the support group at ringconn was slow unhelpful and condescending in handling my issue after many messages to support and responses that were days late or failed to address my issue ringconn finally agreed to ship me a new ring i requested overnight shipment to make up for the lost time and frustration i experienced and they disregarded my request completely instead sending a new ring three days later via usps they repeatedly disregarded my request to have a supervisor contact me several days later i received two rings on consecutive days no sooner had the second ring arrived than i began getting urgent messages from ringconn to return it they asked me to take it to a shipping location which i refused to do i used a shipping label they provided and left it out for my postman to pick up i have rarely experienced such incompetent service nor have i been disregarded as completely as i was by ringconn i was far more diligent in sending back the second ring than they were in addressing my concerns i only hope i don t have an issue with the ring since i have no confidence ringconn will stand behind their product follow up i received a lengthy response from ringconn after posting my review like all their communications it was vague and did not address my concerns i have dealt with online sellers of many products for decades and have never been treated so disrespectfully i ve wasted enough time on this i should have purchased an oura","1"

"customer service terrible i got my ring a little over a month ago it stopped holding a charge already you submit your concern through the app but it usually takes days for them to get back to you they said that they would send me a return label two days ago all i needed to do was confirm my address and that i am ready to mail it i confirmed but then they e mail back today asking me to confirm my ring size so i m sure they won t get back to me for another days it just seems they drag things out quite a bit i haven t been able to use my ring for days and will be much longer at the rate of their customer service update june due to the poor customer service i requested a refund on may they said my refund was of utmost importance and that they would be following it very closely they said i should get it in business days but after business days i still have yet to receive my refund quite honestly the customer service or lack thereof should be enough to discourage anyone from purchasing this ring","1"
"after two months here is my opinion on ringconn the products really impressed me for many reasons the price of is a killer the design is really sick an if award winner for a reason hrv and blood oxygen monitoring is better than oura s that works only at night time battery life of days is wild the results and the sensors are so accurate","5"

"so function and sleep function incorrect the purchase etc went fine but having used it now i find that the so measurement on the ring during sleep has changed to a much lower reading i check with another gadget i have and that i know meets medical standards and that one shows antwo point higher average more or less what i had when i started using the ring ni don t know what changed but this basically makes the ring useless for me as i had bought it specifically to measure that also two nights ago i barely slept and was awake most of the night i got a score on my sleep which is even higher than nights where i know the sleep was mixed i would like to return my ring and get a refund the ring was purchased months ago and i use it typically only at night although i have now had it on for a full week","1"
"loving the ring i ve had several smart watches but i hate wearing a watch so i just didn t bother and they just never really felt accurate i finally switched to ring and absolutely love it it s out of the way decorative but not blingy and it works i feel the step counts are far more accurate the sleep stuff is fascinating and enlightening heart rate oxygen and all that are easy to read i m most enjoying the stress sensor i love to drive but the ring has shown me how stressed i am while driving i can see it now but i had no idea at the time well worth the money","5"
"latest app update a disaster for several months i found the ring to be very helpful in analyzing my sleep the data provided me with a chart of my sleep stages during the night within the past few weeks however the app was updated and i no longer have access to the sleep data chart only a single number telling me my total sleep for the night no more data telling me the amount of light sleep deep sleep and rem sleep i sent in a request to have the problem fixed but the reply was totally unsatisfactory telling me it would be fixed with the next upgrade that might be months if at all i bought the ring based on the data presentation that i was initially provided not on the very abbreviated presentation i now have i have no idea why the company would take such a huge step backward i did not buy the ring based on the skimpy data that is now provided i have no choice but to demand a return of my money","1"

"sizing ring and actual ring are different sizes i bought my ring for christmas of and while i m happy with the data the ring collects the accuracy of all the metrics the battery life and the fact that i get to wear cute bracelets again i m disappointed with the sizing kit and the customer service i wore the size and the size sample rings for weeks on my index finger and ordered a size in silver when i got my actual ring it was way too big for my index finger and kept sliding off i reached out to the company to see if i could return it for a size i did know that all sales are final but i explained that the ring wasn t the same size as the sizing ring and was told no and to try a different finger i do wear my ring on my middle finger because the ring wasn t cheap but it looks awful i even have the sizing ring still and when i hold both rings together there is a noticeable difference in the actual ring and the sizing ring","3"

"fuss free replacement a replacement was given without much fuss after proper verification and a return label was given too however am a bit skeptical that there s already an issue with the ring charger less than months from purchase so if the new ring needs a replacement again in another months should ringconn review their warranty policy as currently the ring is only under year warranty but this will not be reasonable if a replacement is needed every few months so we will wait and see","4"

"months review i ve had my ringconn ring for exactly months now it has given very reliable results over this time period with no significant problems particularly helping me track sleep and steps the step tracking feature has definitely been a helpful motivator in getting me active most every day although i did need to learn exactly how it was measuring steps which was not the number of times my feet touched the ground but was actually the number of times my arms would swing freely as i walked for instance i did need to learn to carry my grocery bag with my right hand in the store and let my left ring hand swing freely if i wanted my shopping walking to count but it s basically been an extremely effective and also very unobtrusive device for helping me monitor these health wellness functions","5"

"a great concept that could use improvements the lack of half sizes was a problem for me i had to choose either a ring that was too tight or two loose when i contacted the company for help they were very noncommittal basically telling me that neither would be a good idea well duh i ultimately decided on too loose because i still wanted to be able to get the ring off if i was bloated or on a hot day that resulted in nearly losing the ring a couple of times on very cold days because it fell right off my finger i finally solved this by purchasing a very thin cheap ring in my size from amazon which i wear on top of my ringconn to keep it from falling off the wellness balance is not explained clearly i check it but other than my sleep activity it s not really intuitive what information i m getting from my vital signs stress scores more info would be more helpful they started giving wellness badges ok cool what exactly am i tracking i pretty much use this to track my steps it s a lot more comfortable than an apple watch i do appreciate being able to use the app without a subscription which is why i chose this over another ring on the market bottom line i like it but i can t say i love it it s a great concept that could use some improvements","3"

"so far so good my ring experience has been good so far i have had my ring about or months fit and delivery were fast and easy the quality of the ring itself is good and the brushed aluminum finish is nice subtle and does not scratch very easily the ring charges quickly and is easy to do using their included pod style charger i wish syncing was a bit faster or even bet automatic each day the free app is a nice touch for following your information it is well laid out and easy to read and understand after just a few uses there have been a continuous stream of updates to the app and ring so that has been a nice upside kudos to the dev team overall i am very happy with my purchase my one piece of advice no matter what ring you purchase is to decide what you are really looking to get out of the information they provide and will you use it to make informed decisions i d give it stars if i could as it s not perfect but pretty great overall","4"
"i love my ringconn ring i love my ring silver color keeps me aware of my stress level if i m getting enough sleep or need to focus more on it steps consistency etc does exactly what i wanted it to do i really like wearing all of my rings i have many in stainless steel and sterling silver and it blends well with all of them i constantly get compliments on my rings and they have no idea that one of them is a health tracker until i mention it if i do lol so this is a perfect health tracker for me vs wrist versions that i ve also had easily break or wear out on me so i love this option and even more so since they aren t just trying to take advantage with yet another monthly subscription which is what made my decision easier i ve had my ring for about months now and am very happy with it thank you ringconn","5"

"all in all a good ring that i would recommend eally like is that the battery what i really like is that the battery doesn t need to be charged for almost a week the sleep diagram with the different phases is also nice what i think would be cool is if you could give the ring to another person and run it under a different profile so that the actual data is not falsified by itself and above all the data is saved on the device in the app without an internet connection","4"

"i like the ring overall i like the ring overall it seems to be well built and durable i haven t dropped it but i have exercised at the gym and worked in the garden with it and it sustained little damage the only issue i have is that it doesn t tell me when it needs to charge i ve gone through the steps on your support page to remedy the problem but i haven t had any success at this juncture the only recommendation i can offer is to fix what i mentioned above and allow the customer the choice to set whether or not they want to receive a daily summary of how they slept the night before the notification can say something like here is your sleep summary from last night i often forget to check my dashboard in the morning because i m busy getting ready for my day consequently i don t check it until later or forget altogether other than that i think you have a great product and it is performing as expected i hope this helps","4"
"i like this more then i thought i i like this more then i thought i would i love the app with so much data and its all easy to understand they even provide some detailed summary to help you use it the ring is nice and comfortable the battery life is amazing i have recommended to several friends the only reason i gave it four instead of five stars is my size fit i know my ring size but that doesn t account for the small sensors the ring has so it is very snug getting it off to charge it","4"
"important and useful health tracking information the ringconn ring provides important health tracking information on a continuous basis the app does a good job of presenting this information in a usable and useful way and allows good user interactions but some information e g peak heartrate readings is not as continuous and as accurate as it could be and some sleep information e g sleep is wrong requires an app update and no update has been made","4"

"neurodivergent helpful detailed sleep and stress the ring is crafted well and never feels too warm or tight loose with the two bumps which was something i was worried about before owning it what sold me on this ring and why i m still very happy with it is that i m a neurodivergent person that struggles with things like severe adhd and a very common comorbidity of that insomnia having a ring that accurately tracks whenever you sleep no matter the time and understands and displays sleep stages has been so useful for me to track and understand so much more about my sleep needs and patterns including learning i have my most efficient and restful sleeps with the best ratio of deep and rem sleep stages when i sleep between hours vs more less hours it also tracks stress levels very well that compares and outdoes what my apple watches did for me in the past but on a ring on my finger instead of a watch that has a poor battery it is also been surprisingly durable and waterproof to where i can just forget it is on i do tend to take it off to charge while i shower but it s not due to not being able to shower with it on i just found that to be the most convenient and efficient way to keep my ring charged without interrupting my schedule i had issues with my ring not keeping charge more than days after months of use and they without hesitation mailed me a replacement to use within the same week this second one has kept its charge same as when i first got it and lasts days but i charge mine more often as mentioned so i rarely have to push it unless i just forget to take it off when i shower speaking of the case it is just great i rarely ever have to plug in the case to charge maybe once a month or longer very very happy with it only improvements i want to see more of is just more features on the app but those are already promised and even within the time of purchasing it until now there have already been new features and bug fixes added routinely which is always a good sign of a healthy app development cycle and a team that is organized and follows agile methodology i m a software engineer so it s easier to spot for the price this is such a good investment for me and i m happy to have jumped onto the ringconn bandwagon over the others i had researched in comparison excited to see what comes next","5"

"pretty good ring but swelling of finger a major issue my ringconn ring has been an interesting experience i purchased this as part of a black friday sale i needed a ring sizing kit and this was sent to me although i felt it was dispatched and delivered a bit slowly i decided on a ring size after wearing the sizing ring a couple of days i wanted the ring to be worn on my non dominant hand the ring arrived in a reasonable time after i selected the ring size online it charged up properly the set up was okay but i did feel that ringconn s app was asking for too much personal information such as my home address it should be asking only for the rock bottom minimum information from the user my home address is not needed for a health tracking application after a time it became clear to me that the ringconn app installed on my iphone was rather basic but it seemed to be sending my health data to a server somewhere on the internet for example to get a report of my health data such as the stress score sleep trends step counts over time the information appears to be made available from a server i have no idea if this information is encrypted on the remote server s or not and what other parties have access to my personal data such as my daily sleep patterns even so for a almost months it was fun to wear my ring daily hours a day except in the shower or when doing some messy chores with my hands like washing dishes it was fun seeing the trends develop over time but then quite recently a problem developed the finger that i used for my ring seemed to start swelling i could not get the ring off easily perhaps this is tied to increasing physical activity on my part or warmer temperatures as the short winter ended and spring arrived i am not sure my skin came off a bit the last time i wrenched the ring off my finger not a lot of skin and there was really almost no pain but there was some minor bleeding that stopped quickly i decided i had better stop wearing the ring recently my finger has healed enough to put the ring back on but the fit is so tight that i m afraid i ll injure the finger again when i need the ring to come off so i m not sure what to do i wish i could have ordered a quarter size larger for example ring size instead of or a half size larger as in i have given the ring to my wife since she is interested in ringconn i think that eventually health tracking rings need to be constructed from flexible materials that can accept some amount of physical expansion or contraction i think ring materials that are flexible in this way are very necessary for me i don t understand why my finger swelled and perhaps it will contract this coming winter with cooler temperatures but the ring is useless to me if it cannot fit on my finger just right also it is important for customers to feel that their personal information is safe that it will not be sold to third parties for any reason that it is secured such that even ringconn employees cannot decrypt someone s personal information that it cannot be decrypted by third parties and that even if the data is stolen by thieves it cannot be decrypted by them either even if the thieves wait a few years and try to decrypt at that future date overall i like the idea of a health tracking ring but the materials need to be improved and the security of my personal data really needs to be assured","2"
"inaccurate and won t let me return this rings oxygen saturation has been inaccurate not matter what i ve tried since i bought it i ve reached out asking for a refund and was told to try it for longer even after a hospital confirmed the reading was much lower than it actually was they won t let me return so very bad experience","1"

"i love this health tracker i love this health tracker i didn t want a smart watch as i have a very nice analog one already so this was the perfect solution i was a bit apprehensive about the quality as it was the less expensive version of the ones on the market but i m more than impressed with the accuracy quality and ease of use i would say the delivery times could use some improvement it took almost weeks to receive the ring sizing kit had another week to receive the actual ring itself i also wish they had a polished version i have the silver one and it looks quite dull compared to my other jewellery however that s quite an petty observation given the functionality of the unit i love the sleep tracking it s really helped me to actively improve the quality of my sleep i ve noticed a direct correlation between the number of steps i get each day and the quality of my sleep and hrv absolutely recommend this health tracker to anyone who is looking for a deeper insight on how to improve their overall health","5"

"good passive solution i am satisfied with the design the application and the passive logic of use smart bracelets always annoyed me when they alert me to something they always want some kind of interaction the ring is a really great solution in this perspective plus i can wear a normal classic analog watch the ring has a very good battery life and the charging solution is elegant i give four stars because the application still needs to develop some functionalities for example different types of exercises and you need to realize that the number of measured steps is always a little overestimated it s logical every person waves his hand all the time not only while walking","4"

"perfect everyday device the ring and accompanying app give great information on my sleep stress levels and activity intensity the app provides the right amount of details and the charts are great at presenting the information in a useful format i also have a fitbit charge and a garmin venu and i find the ringconn the best in these categories small and unassuming doesn t get in the way runs many days without requiring a charge and the small charge case is perfect because it doesn t require you to plug into a wall outlet all the time i have had the ring since february and have yet to recharge the charge case would highly recommend this product for those interested in understanding how their body is behaving","5"

"i enjoy using this ring i enjoy using this ring however the only thing i would suggest is making it easier to know which side is up or down during the day as my fingers swell or shrink the ring turns and i can t determine sometimes where the sensors are i ve gone so far as placing a small sticker on the top of the ring to know it s always in the right position otherwise love the ring and love the free subscription app with all the detailed information","5"

"this is the fitness ring to get after exhaustively researching the big names in fitness rings oura circular ultrahuman and ringconn i chose ringconn ringconn was less expensive had a lot of excellent and believable reviews and perhaps most importantly has no monthly subscription extortion fee which other companies should be absolutely ashamed to charge for such an expensive product the ringconn ring isn t quite as nice looking as some of the others but it looks absolutely fine so i have no regrets on that front i ve been wearing the ring for months it took a few days for the ring to get to know me and provide what appeared to be accurate data but it has been rock steady and excellent ever since the results are consistent with and i think more accurate than my galaxy watch s sleep data the only thing which confuses both my ringconn and my galaxy watch is my bed s vibrating massage function using it typically results in inaccurate sleep data the ringconn app provides detailed information but is very user friendly and easy to understand the few times i found errors in the data which turned out to be caused by the bed s massage function i submitted a ticket through the app and received a satisfactory response within a day the charging box is the best charging system of any ring it is super convenient and works flawlessly i typically charge the ring every few days while i take a shower just because that s convenient but based on the battery level readings in the app one charge would last days i m glad i did so much research before choosing ringconn this brand seem to be the underdog of fitness rings at the moment but i would not be surprised if they end up the leader imho ringconn s product design accuracy price customer service and pay once model leave the others in the dust","5"

"it seems to make the data up initially all seemed well long wait to receive the ring during the kickstarter campaign but the company tried to keep people updated even though their own spreadsheet didn t match up with delivery volumes and dates after wearing the ring for a few months i ve been receiving worrying heart rate data of very high heart rate these figures didn t match up at all with a smart watch readings or an external blood pressure monitor heart rate around bpm ring sometimes records resting heart rate bpm during these high heart rate recording other devices track a higher heart rate of bpm but no where near the figures ringconn records and these are not brief blips of a minute or two but minute periods i have contacted ringconn on a few occasions sending them data showing the high reading and just receive a standard copy and paste reply basically fobbing me off saying they are aware of high heart rate readings and updating software algorithms to correct the issue which never seems to happen as for the rest of the data the ring provides the sleep figures can be way off as well which is the only other metric i can verify and as i ve got no way of checking the rest of the data i ve got no way of confirming how accurate it is ringconn keep updating the design of the app which is pointless if the data it shows isn t accurate basically don t buy a ringconn ring it ll be money wasted","1"

"i went from a fitbit to oura and now to i went from a fitbit to oura and now to ring conn very very happy it has the step accuracy of fitbit oura is not even close to being an accurate step counter this ring automatically recognizes exercise and then rates the level of exercise accurately plus you can t just add a workout and cheat this setup it knows when your working out with fitbit or oura you can manually add the workout which then inflates your heart rate and gives you workout credit whether you actually worked out or not oura is slow to recognize stress this ring is spot on all the time this is the only ring that gives you hr automatic heart rate spo and hrv readings all the time that is super accurate and then gives you an ongoing average all day and night of those metrics come on everyone please realize your hrv is the epicenter of all of your workout or just normal recovery from anything your doing this ring nails it even when compared to my chest strap that measures my hrv and i can see it at a glance anytime wherever i am the information pages are like no other app with ongoing averages to all your other metrics and a trend format like no other i am surprised there is no monthly charge for this app i bought the silver and it is a beautiful ring matte finish in the center to a polished surface on the edges very durable too if i listened to all the marketing bs comparing this ring to the others i might not have bought this ring just buy it and enjoy it is truly the best","5"

"very satisfied user i have been using my ringconn for about a month now and it has been very helpful in monitoring my health i purchased it specifically for the sleep tracking since i can t stand to wear my bulky apple watch to sleep the sleep tracking data is very thorough and complete and gives a score every night on the quality of your sleep which i find helpful at a glance to see how it went as far as the fitness tracking and heart rate i wear both ring and watch during the day and both get the same or very similar results so i believe that the fitness data the ring collects is pretty accurate i have a friend with the oura ring and have compared data with them and the ringconn records the same data without the need for a paid subscription which is a great feature also i think that the ringconn s detailed sleep data is more inclusive than what the oura is able to provide overall i m very happy with my ring and i find it so easy to wear i forget it s there just an fyi the shipping takes a very long time to arrive but that s ok i was able to communicate with support and was reassured that it was on the way and not lost","5"

"finally a serious contender in the health ring arena i just received my order of a gorgeous black ringconn and i have to say how impressed i am with the quality of work that has gone into creating this ring from its packaging to functionality fit and esthetics this health tracking ring beats the front runner in this field hands down for example it can measure blood spo saturation index continuously something that even the oura ring can not do without draining the battery and talk about battery i just love the charging box that comes with it a subtle and functional addition that no other similar smart ring has the ring charges from almost no charge within an hour or so and the charge lasts for a good days the app is also a work of art and packed with live and historical health data and other information you can just tell that a massive amount of work has gone into creating ringconn app alone ringconn also has built in temperature sensors and will soon activate the feature with an app update to measure core body temperature too it currently only measures skin temperature during sleep and again another feature that oura doesn t have as for accuracy i have checked the spo and sleep data against my medical grade oximeter and my zeo ekg device the results are within of each other in contrast my oura ring results are within a margin of error which makes the ringconn an undisputed winner in accuracy as far as i am concerned i would definitely recommend it","5"

"i was in the original purchase group of i was in the original purchase group of ringconn my first experiences with the ring were fantastic much better than oura the hrv was all day and not just during sleep and it was accurate the step counter was also accurate the heart rate was not only accurate but continuous then the ring simply stopped working one night i woke up and there was no sleep data and no hrv data this happened multiple times i wrote to the company and received back a message obviously written by somebody who didn t speak english very well because i ve had the ring for a few months i cannot get my money back so i put the oura ring back on my finger and chalked this up to the normal fraud mongers who are out there looking to take our money caveat emptor be careful of this company once a tracking device misses one day there is never a reason to wear it again this ring has possibilities but isn t ready for prime time expect it to stop working and then expect customer service to write you back and talk to you like english is their sixth language","2"

"ringconn is much better than oura i have been wearing ringconn for a week now i really like this i had oura before i have to admit that oura is good for sleep tracking but in a month for subscription fee is too much as a matter of principle i unsubscribed and i also sold my oura i can compare ringconn sleep tracking to my apple watch i have to say that i believe ringconn more than apple watch ringconn steps calcularor is working too you can see walking distance oura s steps wasnt working i also like ringconn s stress monitoring and also all the other features too i dont miss oura at all some users complaining about scratches well my oura got so scratched that they changed my ring warranty of course these can get scratches in hard use like phones watches etc you can use wrap paper or something if you like to cover your ring somebody said that facebook admin and community are toxic well my experience is the opposite community helps each other and admins are there too they also help people with their problems i sent email to ringconn and they replied at the same day overall i really recommend ringconn better looking than oura these guys updating app ring and i have a feeling that they take this project seriously even more features than oura example stress monitoring no monthly subscription fee and also ringconn is cheaper than oura","5"
