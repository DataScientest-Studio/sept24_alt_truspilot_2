Wish I could give this ring a zero,"Wish I could give this ring a zero! I bought 2 rings. One for my husband and one for myself. Husbands has worked fine. Mine has never worked from the jump. It collected no data, when the ring needed charging, it would tell me it was fully charged. When I first contacted the company they sent me a reassuring email saying don't worry they would look after the situation. Everytime I send them what they ask for, they ask for something additional.

After having the ring for one week it is already scratched up and visible. Considering the price of the ring I tried to get a replacement, especially since it was early on but was offered a $15 refund which I never received.

Buyer beware,"Buyer beware, this company is horrible to deal with. I was offered a replacement when I queried why the ring sizer didn't match the actual ring which then changed as soon as I mentioned a retailer other than Amazon? Strange way to conduct business with new customers!
Be mindful of which retailer you choose, many will not accept returns on this and the company sure as hell won't.
To the company: improve your staff training - the way I have been dealt with is wrong and your staff are reckless and damaging to the business, hence my reviews. Really poor and not worth the cheaper option.",1,2025-07-29T13:46:35.000Z,customer,GB,8.0
Don't purchase these rings - they don't work anymore,"Don't purchase these rings unless you want to be disappointed! When I purchased everything worked. Over the course of 2 years as they worked on the app, they have broken whatever worked for the heart rate and they have also broken how it records your sleep. These features used to work but the heart rate hasn't worked in years so I had to purchase a heart monitor from Polar when I exercise to understand what my heart rate is. Unfortunately you can't track it because that information isn't stored so the ring is useless for the heart rate. For sleep, multiple days a week it tells me I slept for 2-3 hours when I know I was asleep for closer to 7. If you're familiar with these rings they show movement while you're in bed and for hours when it says I'm awake there is no corresponding movement. When I sent them the data and asked them to replace the ring they gave me basic instructions that I already had in my settings - done. It continued to happen so I sent it again. Now they say that there must be micro-movements in my finger or hand that the ring is sensing and therefor it thinks I am awake. So, it's enough movement for the ring to think I am awake but it records no data? When you give feedback via the ring they never want to take responsibility that it may be the app. This ring used to work and now it does not. Plain and simple. As stated, completely useless for heart rate during exercise. I could be killing myself and my Polar heart rate shows that I am and my ring looks no different than when I am walking around my house. As mentioned above sleep is useless now as well. Purchase another ring until they take responsibility. What is it good for? Counting your steps... that's pretty much it. If you're hoping to get good sleep or exercise data look elsewhere.",1,2025-07-29T02:27:26.000Z,Deborah Pashkoff,US,1.0

Great ring,"I struggle with wearing a watch so wanted a discreet ring without an expensive subscription.

The ring came quickly, and support has been good. It does everything I need, waterproof in the pool, i dont notice wearing it, no subscription to pay and no technical issues over the last 2 years.

Only small downside is the little sensors leak a little light at night, but not enough to stop me wearing it.

It’s a bonus to have the Ring Conn look even sleeker than the other brands too! It has been helpful in providing daily insights, but I just wish the app would give us more options to explore or understand our health. It already does that, but I’m seeking more in depth - such as making more sense of the data and providing suggestions or automatically making reports or comparisons to previous data. I have been recommending this ring to everyone I know because it looks great, it feels comfortable, and it does not make me feel obsessive over the measurements on the app. Overall, the biggest buy-in for me is the price is unbeatable for its quality (especially not needing a subscription) - I actually feel that I have the better version of the smart rings.",4,2025-07-16T04:40:14.000Z,Cait,US,1.0

It records steps when I'm simply sitting in my chair and reading a book or watching TV. I've tried different fingers on both hands and results are pretty much the same. Other features like sleep, heart rate, blood oxygen, etc seem to be accurate though.

Great for 12Months. Died As soon as warranty ran out.,"Product WAS great, and also the initial customer service. Good response time etc. however, after just over a year, coincidently the battery of the ring went from lasting easily 6 days to less than 12 hours, 13 months after purchase. The 12 month warranty had ran out and around the same time they had just released the 2nd gen ring. All seems way too much of a coincidence, especially when after contacting customer service they said there was nothing they could do except give me a promo code to purchase the 2nd gen ring with $90 off.
After replying with my concerns about the timing of the ring batteries life span dropping off dramatically so quickly, I asked about guarantees and that if I bought a 2nd gen ring how do I know after 13months the same thing wouldn’t happen again? Or when a 3rd gen ring comes out?…. Obviously I had no helpful response, just a reply from an automated service. Disappointing after being so happy with the product for the first 12 Months.",1,2025-07-15T07:11:48.000Z,Reece,AU,1.0

It was going to be a big hassle with the company to exchange - they wanted all of these videos and photos comparing the ring to the sizer and my finger, plus the original shipping took a long time so I ended up not exchanging and just keeping the ring and getting a spacer to wear with it for a better fit.

They wanted photo/video proof I had used the sizing kit but I used this at a shop in Hong Kong on holiday so I couldn't provide this because at that time I didn't know it would be needed.

It's early but overall very satisfied,"Over all I am very satisfied with the ring. It doesn't have more bells & whistles than necessary. I wish the app was a bit more customizable. I talked to customer service a couple of times for clarification- first time the representative made me feel very confident that the answers they gave were correct. Second time a little different experience but not enough to keep me from ordering. My questions were if the actual ring was the same size as the sizing kit or slightly smaller or bigger. Told slightly smaller, when I got the ring it was actually slightly bigger, very slightly. I went with the size that the sizer was slightly difficult to get over my knuckle. Would have preferred a 1/2 size but informed not available, doesn't hurt to ask. Actual ring slides a bit too easy a 1/2 size smaller would have been perfect.
Look forward using this for a lot longer than I used my Fitbit charge6.",4,2025-06-06T01:57:43.000Z,for your order,US,2.0
Great ring overall! Just needs some improvements in monitoring workouts.,"This has been a great smart ring! The price is right and I love that the app and plethora of data are both free. The first ring I received was not tracking vitals properly, but RingConn was responsive and sent a replacement ring (it did take a couple of weeks). This ring has been consistently tracking data and I love how many graphs are provided for interpretation. It seems to do a good job with step tracking (at least for trends), but it struggles to accurately monitor my heart rate during rowing workouts. I have automatic workout mode detection on and even set it to an indoor cycling workout, but my heart rate is rarely registers above 110 bpm. It does much better during running workouts.

Women’s health cycle tracking was one of my main reasons for purchasing. It’s very simple, but temperature shifts was all I needed, so this does the job just fine.

Overall, I would definitely recommend the ring!",4,2025-06-05T21:53:46.000Z,Karen Linz,US,1.0

Looooooove my ring,Looooooove my ring! I switched from an Apple Watch and it was the best decision ever. My watch was dying all the time and I truly was over getting notifications on my wrist all day but enjoyed the health tracking aspects so kept wearing it. But the ring is sooooo much better. I love tracking my sleep and my cycle. I get excited to wake up and check my sleep score every day. The battery life is amazing. I’ve had the ring about 2 months now and I’ve charged it 3 times for about 30 minutes each and that is all. I also get compliments all the time on how thin the ring is and how my friends with the other big brand wish they had done more research and got this one. 10/10 recommend!,5,2025-05-29T14:29:23.000Z,Megan Guymon,US,1.0

Accuracy

Exceptional Product and Customer Service – A Truly Outstanding Experience,"I've been a dedicated supporter of RingConn since December 2022, initially backing them through their Indiegogo campaign. From the very beginning, their communication has been nothing short of excellent—clear, consistent, and timely.

Over time, I've watched the RingConn Android app evolve through multiple updates, each bringing meaningful improvements. The biometric insights provided by the ring have been both valuable and informative, helping me better understand and monitor my health.

When RingConn released Version 2 of their smart ring in September 2024, I didn’t hesitate to place an order. The purchasing experience was seamless, and once again, their communication throughout the process was top-tier.

In April 2025, I reached out to their customer support team with a question. I was blown away—not only does RingConn offer what I believe to be the best smart ring on the market (especially considering its competitive price, lack of a subscription fee, and robust health tracking features), but their customer support is truly outstanding. Their responses were prompt, clear, and reliable. Most impressively, when they say they’ll follow up—they actually do.

My experience with both the product and the support team has far exceeded my expectations. I wholeheartedly recommend RingConn to anyone looking for a high-quality smart ring backed by exceptional service.",5,2025-05-24T15:37:36.000Z,Jon Washburn,US,2.0

A sleek ring with great features,"I’ve been using the RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring for several weeks now, and I am very happy with it. I never expected the ring to be perfect and there is nothing like a visit to your healthcare provider however, with my experience using the RingConn, I am very satisfied with the close to accurate information I get. The information it provides me keeps me on track with my wellness goals. I especially like the sleep feature, which allows me to see my sleeping patterns and how to improve them. The ring provides various features and although I might not utilize them all, I am glad they are available. I did research on the different health rings available in the market and felt that this particular model of ring would best suit my needs.
The RingConn Gen 2 Smart Ring is a compelling choice for those seeking a high quality health monitoring device without the burden of subscription fees.

The first 3 days I did their sleep apnea tracking and it worked wonderfully. Very cool to see all of the insights as someone with sleep apnea.

Not Accurate,"I went with this primarily for step tracking and sleep information. I've found when I wake up it already has 100+ steps (I don't sleepwalk or get up to go to the bathroom) and I question whether the step count is accurate during the day as well- it always seems very high. And the sleep must be based on being horizontal? I was recently traveling and got some great, long sleep on some plane rides but the ring totally missed it. And then it counted a massage as my being completely asleep. I may have dozed off for a minute or two lol but definitely did not sleep through the whole thing. I took it off after that and haven't been inclined to wear it again. A bummer though, it's expensive and I am interested in tracking this information!",1,2025-05-16T19:35:52.000Z,Julia,US,1.0

Liars and a scam,"My ring was having problems getting correct data readings. I contacted customer service by email because the phone number goes straight to voicemail and they do not call you back.
For 3 weeks, I had a gen 1 ring and after a week of talking they offered me $100 a gen 2 ring, so I picked one the gen 2 air. They came back and said that offer was $50, I told them they didn't specify which one so they can't do that. Days later they email me and tell me they will send it for free. They confirmed my address twice and nothing. So the next email they wanted me to send back the old one first and then they would send the new one. That came out of nowhere and they had never said this before. I advised I was not comfortable with that since all the problems so far. We confirmed my address again and they said they would ship it right away with a return slip for the other one inside. That was a week ago and still nothing, so I have to email again
I also started to screen shot the emails as I noticed they were deleting some where they stated things they promised they were going to do and never did.
This company is a scam, bunch of liars, and all you will get is emails to appease you. If you don't constantly email them sometimes 2 and 3 times a day cause your haven't gotten a response they just send you another email of something else they want you to do that was never part of the discussion.

I followed their instructions and placed a new order. However, after a lengthy shipping process, I received a package containing a sleep mask and an aromatherapy kit—no ring. I contacted support again, and while they did investigate with the shipping provider and issued a refund, I was left scrambling to find a replacement birthday gift.

caffeine & water intake, wether, been outside or not, felt grateful or not, motivated?, inspired?, emotions and our own subjective interpretations!!!!!

"Not accurate, lots of issues",The ring does not automatically track exercise as it claims. There are also very limited types of exercise you can log and it can’t be done after the fact. It also does not accurately track heart rate during exercise and maxes out around 135bpm. It also then flags elevated heart rate during exercise as an outlier which affects your health score. Step tracking is also not accurate. Basically a glorified sleep tracker and with the other issues not sure I can trust even that. Probably would not have purchased if I’d have known about this issues.

I find it extremely offensive and frustrating that I can’t turn this off, despite not having the exercise options on. It thinks I’m taking steps when it’s been over a dozen years when I took any. Please, please update this! Even the Apple Watch has a wheelchair user option to recognise if a person does not have the ability to be mobile.

I do weightlifting, volleyball, yoga, boxing…etc. It’s totally my fault for not doing more research. I really like everything else about it. If it tracked more exercises then it would be a 5 star.

"Theres nothing ""smart"" about it.","Review for Ringconn Gen 2

Overall, really disappointed in this product.
I honestly want to return it. But one, it will cost me to ship it back. and two, I dont have time to deal with that right now.

Its basically a wearable ring health tracker. theres nothing ""smart"" about it.
It only writes data, it doesnt read. meaning that it can only go off its own data.
I wish i did more research and got something with more integration, AI, habits, and insights.
the main reason i chose this ring was for the sleep apnea and O2 tracking, which im not even happy with.

only positive i have is the battery life.

Negatives:
* you can tell from its language that it was manufactured in china.
* iv had issues with the O2 not reading correctly, which is the primary reason i got it.
* I also got it specifically for the sleep apnea tracking, but what i didnt find out till i got it, is that you have to turn on that setting for it to work, its not tracking everyday on its own. also it says that it consumes more battery life as well.
* I get warnings for ""outliers"" in my heart rate and HRV all the time, but its mostly because my schedule varies so much.
* also considers my panic attacks as ""moderate to high - intensity activity / exercise mode"" even when heart rate is unusually high and theres little to no movement.
* i also hate how they have ads on facebook that you can wear it while swimming and in the sauna, but when you read about the ring in the app, it specifically says you shouldnt wear it in the sauna.

Those are all the issues i can think of off hand, but im sure theres more.

Great alternative to smart-watch for biometrics.,"Ringconn
Good product.

The app covers all the biometrics comprehensively. Information is displayed well and has both (i)explanations and (>) break-out boxes with more detail.
Previous daily data is a matter of swiping right (and left to come back). Judging from the calendar drop down this will probably include daily data for as long as you keep it.
Longer term trends are also available from a different tab.

The ring is easy to wear, remarkably lightweight, and looks good. The ring's durability has yet to be fully tested but has survived a fair amount of basic tool use and gardening so far. I don't avoid getting it wet with the exception that I avoid putting it in hot water (dishes, showers etc).

There's always minor issues that may be in development or just personal preferences, nothing at all show stopping though.
(Audience for the following is more for the developers.)
Y-Axis of graphs varies across days making visual comparisons inconclusive.
.. there could be user defined ranges.
.. or ranges could be re-aligned automatically when required.
.. these could be toggled on/off.
X-Axis includes multiple data points per column.
.. a single column contains low,medium,high,vigorous.
.. this could be a minute by minute line showing the fluctuations.
.. again this could be toggled on/off.
Sleep value went down after unusually large amounts of sleep.
.. makes sense, something is wrong... but;
.. app says ""slow down"", so is only looking at final score, not gross value of sleep.
(Also records 'sleep' while I'm screen-reading books)
The Stress indicator appears remarkably inaccurate. I don't know enough to make suggestions but it is an area that would likely benefit from some more research.
Data doesn't update without an internet connection.
.. surely the base calculations are simple enough to process on device. There are times when it quite difficult to obtain internet on a regular basis.
Some of those points would be concessions to battery life, and battery life was a primary consideration of purchase.",5,2025-04-21T00:30:32.000Z,CraigB,AU,1.0

The included charger is smaller but it doesn't include a battery like the standard model. I guess that's how they reduced the price. Personally I like the smaller charger and I don't mind charging it once a week. I do wish the gold color choice was available for the Air model. Now to the App... it doesn't have all the health metrics that the Apple watch has, but for what it does measure, the ring and watch are in close agreement. The RingConn app is easier to read at a glance and also easier to navigate. Drilling down, the detail is sensibly displayed using easy to understand graphs and charts.

RingConn Gen 2 Review from 🇩🇪,"RingConn Gen 2 Review – A Sleek Alternative to the Smartwatch

I’ve been using the RingConn Gen 2 for about three weeks now, and I have to say—I’m genuinely impressed.

Customer Support That Delivers
My experience started on a positive note even before the ring arrived. I accidentally ordered the wrong size, but after contacting customer support, they quickly and efficiently arranged for the correct size to be shipped instead. The entire process was smooth, and I received the perfectly fitting ring without any issues.

A Small Device with Big Capabilities
What really surprised me was how advanced this little ring is when it comes to tracking health data. It captures a wide range of metrics throughout the day with impressive accuracy. As someone who has used smartwatches in the past, I’d say the RingConn is a compelling alternative—especially for those looking for something more discreet and lightweight.

Whether you're monitoring workouts, sleep, or vital signs, the ring delivers solid insights. That said, during strength training or any activity involving weights, I’d recommend using finger tape to avoid potential scratches.

Comfort & Fit
I’m not someone who normally wears rings, but I quickly got used to this one. It feels natural on the finger and doesn’t shift or feel loose—even during runs or fast, sudden movements. I never once felt like it might fall off.

Final Thoughts & Sizing Tip
The RingConn Gen 2 combines style, comfort, and functionality in a surprisingly compact form. For anyone looking to track their health without the bulk of a smartwatch, this ring is absolutely worth considering.

My recommendation for sizing:
I suggest choosing a comfortable size for your index finger that also fits snugly on your middle finger and slightly looser on your ring finger. This gives you flexibility and ensures the ring stays comfortable throughout the day, no matter which finger you wear it on.",5,2025-04-15T20:39:11.000Z,Metha Minks,DE,1.0

The return process unfortunately falls short.,The return process unfortunately does not work well for the customer. I had to change ring sizes due to the ring being to loose. I used the sizing kit to choose the correct ring but the actual ring size fit to loosely. I had to ship the old ring back before they would ship the replacement which I had to pay for shipping. Ringconn provided a shipping label which ended up being ground shipping. This meant the ring would not get back to ringconn for 3 to 5 days. Meaning the new ring would not be shipped until received. I will be without the ring for almost two weeks. I consider this poor customer service. As a note sleep data is vastly over stated. The REM and DEEP stats are between three and four hours a night combined. My apple watch and Garmin are both under 2 hours. Based on the return experience and data issues I don't recommend this Ring. One positive note the battery life is amazing.,2,2025-04-13T03:53:23.000Z,Herbert Hoelle,US,5.0

LOVE the RingConn!!!,"I love the RingConn! I got my husband and myself the RingConn Gen 2 because of the longer battery life and the sleep apnea monitoring - the measurements it gets is accurate and the fact that you don't have to pay for a subscription is amazing and the primary reason we didn't get an Oura ring. The RingConns are super light feeling and it's nice that you can sync it to Apple Health and the Android Health, too. The only comments I have are that I wish the app has an option to put in health issues that affect your vitals and that the sizing rings versus the RingConn feel slightly different (the RingConn feels a couple of millimeters larger than the practice one, so we just bought spacers to help the sizing which worked) but it's overall great!

The data and analytics in the app are quite basic, the AI feature and goal plans could be utilized more to make the ring better.

I placed an order in February and never received the ring. When I reached out to customer service, I was met with cold, robotic replies that all start and end exactly the same. Every time I asked a question, even if it was a follow-up on the same issue, they just copied and pasted the same paragraph. It’s like talking to a bot, not a real person. There’s zero effort to actually help or resolve anything.

After going back and forth for weeks, I still have NO ring, NO refund, and NO clear explanation of what’s going on. It honestly feels like they’re just stalling, hoping I’ll give up. Their process is incredibly frustrating and makes you feel powerless.

I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone. The lack of transparency, accountability, and basic human support is shocking. Avoid at all costs.",1,2025-04-07T05:58:55.000Z,MPNR,MX,1.0

Data Accuracy,"The data provided by the ring in many cases is totally inaccurate. In particular the sleep analysis can be way off.

More good than bad,"PROS: (1). Lightweight, attractive, well-built, comfortable to wear (2). User-friendly interface with easily understood and accessible data. GUI not “gimmicky” (3). Sleep apnea evaluation option (4). Fast response from customer service to questions (5). Outstanding battery life with fast recharge.
CONS: (1). Simply not dependable as a step-counting activity tracker. For instance, mowing on a riding lawn tractor for a few hours results in 17,000 steps counted. Per customer service: “certain devices may misinterpret some arm movements as walking, leading to an overestimation. Also, the ring estimates step count based on accelerometer data and other sensor inputs. Therefore, in daily life, certain movements—such as unconscious actions caused by ankle pain or hand movements while sitting—may sometimes be misinterpreted as steps, leading to an overestimation of step count.” So, 17,000 steps counted while seated. No sh*t, Sherlock! (2). Less than useful advice, like “The REM state still has room for improvement” without further recommendations.
OVERALL, while the device provides a wealth of data, much of that data and evaluation seems integrated into questionable accelerometer data, so the balance of the data feels less reliable than I had expected.

I've had a cracking experience with this ring, but its days are now numbered - sadly.

Now, I did message Ringconn on a social media channel, which never got a reply and is basically rubbish service (especially these days - not even an acknowledgement).

Ringe size change RingConn Gen 2.,"I had to change my RingConn Gen 2 Mate Black size 13 to size 12 and had a good customer experience with the RingConn support Team in changing the ring size against a little fee. I think the difference to the the size kit is also quite strong related to the swelling in cold and warm weather also the swelling in the night. For example with ring size 12, i can use it in the night an the left indexfinger and in daytime on the right index finger, while with size 13 i can wear in the night at the right index finger, but in daytime i'm losing it from both index fingers. Regarding functionality i'm quite happy, regarding walking steps it seems to overestimate in comparison to my Garmin Fenix 7 watch. I' very happy with sleep recording and sleep apnoe screening.

The support team was great with the whole process. The ring does what it is supposed to. The thinner side walls make for a very comfortable wear.

Buying and using the RingConn2,"Key points: Pros- great service, smooth buying experience and love the product. Sleep tracking is excellent. (For women- cycle tracking aspect is intuitive and un-intrusive)
Cons- only registers running and cycling as exercises, no manual entry for other forms of exercise or times when you can't wear it.

I backed the RingConn2 in its Kickstarter campaign. The whole process was smooth and hassle free. I got my sizing kit fairly quickly, and wore a few different sizes to see what felt right. I found it very difficult to select the right size, but eventually settled on one. When the time came, I selected my colour and size, and sat back and waited for my order to be shipped. Once I got it, I discovered that the fit was not as I expected, but enough larger than the demo sizer to not fit me properly, so I requested a size exchange. This went through without a hitch, and I absolutely LOVE my RingConn2 ring! It tracks my sleep very well (which is the main reason I got it) and all my other bios. The one and only nit that I would pick would be that you can't enter manual exercise entries, and the ring only records running & cycling. This means that the fitness classes that I do where I can't wear the ring don't get recognised as active/activity times. Also, it doesn't register any of the fitness classes I do as exercise, and if it's a low/no impact class that doesn't register any steps but does raise the heartrate, the app registers my exercise as moderate stress.
This is not enough of an issue to impact my satisfaction with the ring and the process of buying it online.
The cycle tracking is fairly basic but pretty easy to use and easy enough to modify if needed. The interface is intuitive and un-intrusive.",5,2025-03-01T14:04:35.000Z,Lyndell Manson,AU,2.0

But I don’t know for sure. The support team worked with me and got me a replacement, it did take a while but it was a new release ring at the time. It tracked everything very accurately. I have compared the 02 readings to my pulsox finger reader and the 02 and puls are always within 1-2 points. The ring is light and there are plenty of cover options. The sleep monitor is pretty accurate. Might be off by 15-30 min for sleep time sometimes. I am excited for them to add more exercise to track.

I mentioned to customer support and after trying a few things to troubleshoot they quickly offered a replacement ring. Arrived quickly and with not drama I also love that they listen to their customers as well when a new update included a dark background (resulting in even longer battery life) I was very upset as it made it very difficult for me to read.

"Simple, Efficient, Long Lasting Smart Ring in the Market!","Why RingConn? I've tried other smart fit tracker device and smart watches are not for me. I'm personally looking for a smart ring device that is simple, efficient and has long lasting battery. Comparing it with other brands in the market, their technology and ""free app"" integration were the wins for me. Not to mention, its affordable price range. I wanted to use it mainly to keeping track of my heart rates and primarily my sleep. I got the RingConn 2 Silver from their Black Friday sale on their website as an early Christmas gift for myself! It was definitely worth the purchase! Shipping was fast to the Philippines. Make sure first to get their sizing kit to ensure you'll get the perfect and comfortable fit. I've been using it for the past three months and it's pretty much seamless- sometimes I forgot that I'm wearing it. One downside though is the silicone ring protection. It's thin enough for comfort however not that durable as it got essily worn out. Nonetheless, this dmart ring device serves its purpose to let me know how I'm sleeping and a motivation to drive a fit lifestyle. Thank you RingConn Team!

But most of all, I'd like to see tracking for people with chronic illness. We have different needs than always healthy people, but we are also in need of health tracking like this.

Best SmartRing,"I’ve had this ring for two or three months now, and I’ve been wearing it almost every day, and I love it! I found the sizing to be pretty accurate to the kit that they offer. With the gold finish, beware that the palm side of the ring will scratch if you’re using it to work out with dumbbells, etc. However, this is expected and the most visible parts of the ring hold up very well to every day wear and tear. I love the app and how easily accessible everything is, and the battery life of the ring is exceptional! It really does last around 10 days on a full charge. I bought this ring because I didn’t like the sporty look of most smart watches, as I typically have to wear business professional clothing. Both me and my friend whom I recommended the ring to love this wearable technology! And let’s not forget that you don’t have to pay to use the RingConn app😉",5,2025-02-28T01:02:20.000Z,Megan,US,2.0

The product is ok,The product is good. The application is good with a lot of data. I don’t like that there are only 3 options to choose to track exercise. I do multiple forms of exercise and can only track running and biking. That’s stupid. I wrote RingConn and they sent an absurd reply regarding an “algorithm” that makes it difficult to track. I especially do not like the fact that the terms and conditions/privacy agreement basically states that all data obtained from the device is property of the People’s Republic of China (PRC).

Great Resource,"I received my ring about 6 weeks ago and really enjoy it. I love the step tracker, sleep tracker, and that it will track my stress and vital signs which is important to me. I enjoy that I can share data with friends…my husband and I have a competition for who gets more steps (and sleep!) I have noticed that it will label it “light sleep” when I’m laying down watching a movie. The only other thing I would love to be able to do is trigger it to track my vitals at specific moments. Otherwise, I say it was a great investment and appreciate that there isn’t a monthly fee.",4,2025-02-21T16:59:48.000Z,Stephanie K,US,1.0
Great ring,"I love the ease of connecting the ring to the Bluetooth and the app.

Great health monitor.,"The ring was slow to ship, but it has been worth the wait. I love the detailed information and functionality provided in the app all without a monthly subscription. The sleep apnea monitoring is a big part of why I waited to puchase a higher end health monitor. It appears accurate. The readings are even a little higher than what my CPAP machine reads. The only thing lacking is it's ability to pick up naps, but at least they can be manually added. Additional exercise options would be nice too.

Sort of good,"I bought the ring with the hope of replacing a monitoring band for sleep and stress tracking.
The experience has been ok...ish. It tracks your pulse and blood oxigen quite accurately. Also stress during the day is pretty accurate.
When it comes to sleep tracking, that's where things take a turn for the worse. While it is quite good in identifying when you go to sleep (it makes the difference between sleeping and just lying on the couch watching a movie), the actual sleep parameters, I find are quite off. You generally wake up to a sleep score of over 85 even on bad nights. HRV during the night, for me, was quite unchanged, whether I had a relaxation day or an intense workout day with lots of work besides it. It generally overshoots both REM and Deep Sleep, undershooting awake time.
Activity tracking is limited to walking, running and biking and only if location is turned on. This last part, for me, was enough reason to not use it as an activity tracker.
On the plus side, support is really fast on answering questions and addressing problems, however, I do not know how much of the feedback they use for improvement.
There is lots of potential in this ring, but some of the aspects really need atention.",3,2025-02-21T07:21:38.000Z,Dan,RO,4.0

Super disappointed,"I loved the ring at first, loved the data and keeping track of my health. But after six months the battery will no longer hold a charge and it is basically useless. I contacted ringconn and they insist that I do a bunch of troubleshooting and track data for two weeks to prove that it’s not working. They refuse to replace it until I’ve done this, and I have my doubts that they will replace it even then. I guess that’s the risk you take when you try a new product that hasn’t been around long enough to really test.

Also a competitor has the option to be woken up when in light sleep rather than deep sleep and if that could be in the next update that would be huge for me. I would be open to more notifications too because I feel like I’ve only gotten them when the battery was dying.

My ring simply doesn't accurately track…,"Based on my experiences over the past two weeks of continuous use—both during the day and at night—I have some concerns about the RingConn's activity tracking accuracy. Specifically, I've noticed that the sleep tracking data appears to be significantly off. For example, on the first two nights, despite getting nearly 7 hours of sleep, the app recorded only about half that duration. I initially expected that ongoing use might help refine the sleep tracking algorithm, but so far, the nightly data has not improved.

For additional context, I primarily wear the ring on my left index finger, and occasionally on my middle finger, where it fits perfectly. As a comparison, I monitored my sleep with an Apple Watch, which consistently recorded around 7 hours of sleep each night. This contrast between the two devices leads me to question the overall reliability of the RingConn in tracking sleep and daily activity accurately.",2,2025-02-05T21:58:39.000Z,Richard Allen,US,2.0

The sleep is pretty accurate for me.

Pro and cons,"The sleep tracking is quite accurate and stable compared with many other trackers. The heart rate monitor too.
The app is just right, simple and not overwhelming.
It doesn't feel bulky wearing it.
The step tracking is actually very bad, sometimes I get up in the morning, I get to the kitchen and I have 300 steps counted.
The exercises are very very limited, there is nothing about anaerobic exercises such as bodyweight.
I hate the fact that I need the charger to exit airplane mode, in 2025 it shouldn't be. I can't wear it while welding ( which is a big part of my job) and my phone drains the battery looking for the ring, if I put it in airplane mode I need to bring the charger with me, but most of smart ring wearers do it because of the very small size of it and if I need to bring the charger at work it loses part of the porpoise.

Best smart ring,"Amazing Innovation – The RingCon Smart Ring is a Game-Changer!

I recently purchased the RingCon Smart Ring, and it has completely exceeded my expectations. This innovative device seamlessly blends style, functionality, and advanced technology into a sleek, wearable gadget that has quickly become an essential part of my daily life.

Compact Yet Powerful

Despite its small size, the RingCon Smart Ring offers a wide array of features. From fitness tracking to health monitoring, it delivers accurate and reliable data, all at the tip of your finger—literally! It’s hard to believe how much technology is packed into such a lightweight and comfortable accessory.

Health and Fitness Tracking

The fitness tracking capabilities are outstanding. It tracks heart rate, steps, calories burned, and even sleep patterns with impressive accuracy. I love waking up and checking the detailed breakdown of my sleep cycle, which has helped me make significant improvements to my routine.

Seamless Connectivity

Pairing the ring with my smartphone was quick and effortless. The app is intuitive, with a clean interface that makes it easy to access insights and reports. Notifications and alerts from my phone are subtle yet effective, ensuring I stay connected without the constant distraction of checking my device.

Stylish Design

The RingCon Smart Ring is as stylish as it is functional. Its sleek, minimalist design makes it perfect for everyday wear, whether I’m at the gym, at work, or out for the evening. It doesn’t feel bulky or intrusive, and I’ve received countless compliments on its modern aesthetic.

Battery Life That Impresses

One of the standout features is the impressive battery life. A single charge lasts several days, which is incredibly convenient. I never feel tied down by constant charging, which is a huge bonus for any wearable device.

Durability and Comfort

The ring is made with high-quality materials that are not only durable but also comfortable for all-day wear. I barely notice it on my finger, and it holds up well to daily activities, including workouts and washing my hands.

Why I Recommend It

The RingCon Smart Ring is the perfect combination of practicality, style, and cutting-edge technology. Whether you’re looking to improve your health, stay connected, or simply own an innovative piece of tech, this ring is a fantastic choice.

Final Thoughts

RingCon has truly outdone itself with this smart ring. It has quickly become a staple in my routine, and I can’t imagine going back to life without it. If you’re on the fence about purchasing one, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try. You won’t regret it!

Buyer Beware,"Hello Everyone, I was one of the original backers of RingConn. For us Ringcon promised a 2 year warranty. My ring has stopped working correctly after a year and half and now needs to be charged daily. They have said/admited that this should not happen and it is a warranty issue. They have really handled my defective ping poorly. They offered only $110 towards a Gen2 ring which is a joke. When I said no they offered to send me a new gen 1 ring. Both options are not good but at least the gen 1 replacement is better. I accepted that option. Now they're saying they don't have it and not sure when they will and they just expect me to wait. I've also read they are not manufacturing any more Gen 1 rings so it seems they just hope this will go be forgotten and go away. This is crazy. I have asked them to escalate this issue but I can feel the pushback like afraid to escalate to a manager. Also, it's sometimes days at a time before I receive a response back from them. The rings are not cheap as we all know. They have handled this very poorly and in my mind unacceptable if they were a reputable company.",1,2025-01-14T00:21:24.000Z,Jack Allen,PH,3.0

Love this ring! - from a newbie smart ring owner,"Ring is extremely well-made, with comfortable slim fit, much less bulky than any other ring on the market. Fit is slightly different than sizing kit, but this is most likely due to the smooth, slick internal coating of the ring versus the plastic material of the sizer. Comfortable to wear all day and all night. I find that the app is well-made, and although the app update changed the look of the main metrics page, it is intuitive and appears pretty accurate, particularly from a sleep tracking perspective. And the sleep score is extremely helpful--even when I get adequate or at least better length of sleep, I can associate my quality of rest accurately with a good or bad sleep score.

Great ring but software could be improved,"I love my RingConn ring. As I also own the gen 3 Oura ring I feel that I can provide a meaningful perspective.

Pros: RingConn has a slimmer profile, longer battery life, and best of all, no monthly fee. In addition, I have a rare limitation in that the Oura ring doesn't accurately read my heart rate, while both gen 1 and gen 2 versions of the RingConn read my heart rate flawlessly.

Cons: Where RingConn falls short is that some of the software aspects are not quite as good as Oura. For example, Oura has much better accuracy at reading when I'm awake vs being asleep. Many times where the RingConn shows me sleeping, the Oura accurately recognized that I was awake and reading a book. Another area where RingConn falls short is that there is no integration with partner software, so it doesn't recognize workouts I might have done that are recorded on Strava and Apple Health.

The RingConn app is good with lots of useful information. I find that the AI aspect is not very useful and gets in the way of just looking at the data. In contrast, Oura has a slightly more meaningful UI that makes it easier to understand the data presented.

Overall I can recommend the RingConn. It's solid, reliable and the lack of a monthly membership fee is a welcome benefit.",4,2024-12-13T07:33:01.000Z,George Pytlik,CA,2.0

I seem to be having connectivity issues with the G2 as it is disconnecting more often than the G1 would. The largest size ring 14 is a little tight for my hand but that's not a big deal,larger size would be great. Overall very pleased with performance and data collected.
Pros: light weight,aesthetics good,accurate readings,app easy,battery life good.
Cons: random disconnect, reset through charger,size for me personally need larger,has on occasions connected to random phone of friend( no data transfer to random phone though) mindful of scratching when using weight exercise( normal with any ring).
I would and have highly recommended this health tracker as accurate and worth the cost.",4,2024-12-13T06:03:48.000Z,Brendon Mimmo,AU,2.0

I tend to ""chill"" in the evening and apparently the ring sometimes counts me as sleeping at that point - probably my only disappointment so far. Not sure what I think of the ""AI"" yet.

My experience has been great,My experience has been great. I was excited why I found out at the ringcon2 and preorders from kick starter. So how I did receive my email/code to preorder on their site. I reached out them think it would be to late and sorry we can't do anything type of response. To my surprise it was literally the opposite. They seemed genuinely sorry that I didn't get the emails/links. Even know it was still past the time they created a link/code that allowed me to still get the presale deal. But then they also followed up to make sure it worked for me and I was able to do. That is what I called amazing customer service. As for the ring it's self I'm in love with it. My wife has the Samsung ring and my sister has the Aura. I have better battery life and I like interface better also. Great product and amazing customer service. I will say to be transparent the one thing I do not like is the ring protector. I've tried two different sizes to see if I maybe grow to liking it. Nope sorry. It made the ring seem bulky and cheap. That's saying a lot saying this ring is smaller then the others. I have large hands and it's the perfect size. It's not so tiny thits dainty but not large. It's like the perfect size for for anyone. Sorry guys about ring protector just have to be honest. Otherwise customer for life and recommend the ring hands down.

Amazing ring,"First, I'll start with the obvious. The battery life is amazing. You have to think so seldom about it while it collects the data. Second, the fit is wonderful. Much thinner than the test ring. I usually hate rings, but this one just found a permanent home. Have gotten so many compliments. I've only had it for a month, but haven't scratched or scuffed it yet. Connectivity always works (which is refreshing).

On the it's ok side is the app. Some elements are great others are annoying. I actually liked the app version I started with much more than the current version. They updates a week or so in and it was disappointing. The plan and AI elements are more in the way for me now. Most of this tech is new, so it's likely to improve.

The metrics that the ring measures are comprehensive and accurate (I'm a consultant physician). I see progressive improvements to the app and firmware that bring new features. I've never experienced any glitches. Most satisfying is the long battery life and lack of subscription.,5,2024-12-07T23:09:39.000Z,Kang,CA,1.0
Couldn’t be happier!,"After a lot of research, I chose the Ringconn gen 2 and am so happy I did! Love, love, love that no subscription is required to get all the data. Steps don’t match my smart Watch, but have always questioned its accuracy and think the ring is probably more accurate. Got it mainly to track sleep and find it very comfortable to wear (played around with the sizing kit to choose the best finger and size for comfort and am very pleased). Once size was submitted, the ring arrived very quickly. The app paired with my phone easily and is very easy to navigate. Love only having to charge weekly!",5,2024-12-06T11:14:10.000Z,Bridget,US,1.0
Over promised- under delivered,"Over promised- under delivered
Horrific company!

Bought on Kickstarter where they promised a delivery date which was then delayed by over 2 months. Essentially they had problems with fulfillment with certain sizes. There was no communication on this until I chased with 20 or so emails back and forth with 'customer service' where they eventually said I would receive a refund with 30 days. Emailed them after 30 days as still no refund. I then magically receive an email saying you refund is being processed. Why did I not receive that email initially? I'll now wait another 10 days for the refund to appear.",1,2024-12-05T09:47:55.000Z,Tabs Islam,GB,3.0

However, you changed the interface to show the KCAL Activity Calories vs. ""Total Carlories!"" Most people including me, want to see how many ""Total Calories,"" so we can adjust what we eat, etc. Activity Calories is good, but is not nearly as helpful in my opinion.

I love everything about my RingConn!,"I love everything about my RingConn!
I love that there is no charge for the app.
I love how light the ring is compared to the Ora ring.
I love how it gives me detailed information about my sleep such as my rem sleep , deep sleep , heart rate , and light sleep among other details.
The first thing I check in the morning is my sleep score.
This has helped me with getting to bed at an earlier time and has helped me cut way back on alcohol because it drastically affects your sleep score.
When I drink wine or stay up to late my sleep score is in the 60’s and my deep sleep and rem sleep are less than an hour.
Otherwise it’s in the high 80’s and mid 90’s and my deep sleep and rem sleep are over 2 hours each.
I love that it tracks all my steps without having to have my phone attached to me.
The only downside is ,it took 7 weeks for me to receive it. I guess it comes from overseas . It was definitely worth the wait . I love it!",5,2024-11-29T15:34:21.000Z,Tamara from Myrtle Beach SC,US,1.0
Ring that never arrived,"After making a purchase, I've been waiting over a month for a ring that never arrived. Supposedly sent on 21.10, track has been lost on 29.10 somewhere in Holland. RingConn didn't resolve it, did not send another piece, and could not even say when it would be sent. I got the feeling that the company forced me to cancel as the price for the ring has been raised lately, so it's better for RingConn to sell a piece for $387 to another person instead of sending it to me, as I took faith in the company and made a preorder. So I've cancelled the order and now I am waiting for my money to be returned.
Contact is artificial and lacks real information. Very bad experience, I cannot recommend buying from RingConn from anyone from my friend, unless they surprise me by something in the end.",1,2024-11-29T15:34:10.000Z,Kamil,PL,1.0

Price is really high for the apps limited offerings, and the sleep data is not accurate sometimes and needs a way to edit it in detail not all of it at once. That's a huge issue that affects overall trends in my opinion. Overall like the ring, battery is great, outside of it is matte which I love, but looks plastic to others lol.

Awesome ring!,"This ring packs a powerful punch, so don’t let the size fool you. I bought a lot of smart rings to test a lot of them out and this one by far is the best in the market! First thing is I like that it’s thin because that makes a huge difference since some of them are just so thick, It’s uncomfortable to work with. Battery life is exactly what they State, it lasts just about two weeks or so. Other rings if they’re constantly running in the background like measuring heart rate or pulse ox. For example, it drains the battery like crazy but this ring does not. To me there’s no point of wearing a smart ring If it’s not going to constantly measure the details without dying so quick. The price of the ring to me is pretty fair considering what you’re expecting to work out of a good item. The saying you buy cheap you get cheap is exactly the case with all these smart rings. And the material they make this out of does not damage easily at all, which is another big plus for me if you are rough. The measurements are very accurate because I put it to the test; since I work in the medical field, it makes it a little bit easier to measure things. So overall, this is an excellent ring to keep track of things If you don’t always want to use your Apple Watch or any smart watch for that matter. I have used this for a few months now, so I can accurately measure If it lives up to the expectations.The only thing I hope that they add in the next software update would just be to measure blood pressure. Since all the other smart rings do that and for this one measuring everything under the sun, they just didn’t add blood pressure check. So I hope to see that shortly, but looking forward to the third generation whenever it comes out!",5,2024-11-28T17:11:12.000Z,LC,US,1.0

Disappointed... lack of support & service,"I’m quite disappointed with the service. I ordered the RingConn Gen 2, but instead of the correct sizing kit, your team sent me the Gen 1 sizing kit. When I tried to resolve this through your support team, they took days to respond. When they finally did, they instructed me to place an order using the Gen 1 sizing kit.
Following their advice, I ordered a size 12, but it feels a size larger. If I had been provided the correct Gen 2 sizing kit, I might have chosen a size 11 instead, as the thinner design of Gen 2 offers less resistance.
To make matters worse, the package was supposed to include the ring protector, but it wasn’t included. After reaching out again, I received the wrong size protector (M instead of L for a size 12 ring). At this point, I didn’t even bother contacting support again—I’m simply too exhausted and frustrated by the repeated mistakes and lack of accountability.",2,2024-11-28T15:25:56.000Z,Naresh Kevlani,SG,1.0

"Great data, good hardware, awful UI.","The hardware seems to work as expected and I had no problems with delivery. The battery life is insanely good. The ring is very slim and comfortable. The weak point is the paint (matte black). It is already starting to scuff after only a week. I was hoping it was more robust. I also wish they had a size 15 ring. The 14 does not fit my index or middle fingers. The recent UI update is atrocious.

I originally chose RingConn because it was efficient at showing simple raw data. I was willing to put up with a beta interface assuming it would become more professional and exceed competitors.

The recent UI update is inefficient with the data, and the beta AI w/emojis, smiley faces, and colorful flowers doesn’t match the rings original audience. The AI literally just tells you what you see if you saw the data charts. The UI change feels like a bait and switch from the original portrayal of the app software.

Besides being silly looking, If someone has blurry vision or color blindness, the butt-leaf clover is very difficult to work with compared to the previous diamond. It looks blurry, and is a downgrade in function.

Hopefully RingConn fixes it soon.",2,2024-11-28T00:19:31.000Z,Austin K,US,1.0

After 2 weeks of wearing the new Gen 2…,"After 2 weeks of wearing the new Gen 2 I can attest that it is not accurate. Steps are way off! It gave me the same step count for a very active day as a day I rode in a car for 7 hours and had virtually no exercise. I took a walk around the block and literally counted my steps and the ring gave 80-100 steps to every 20 steps I physically counted. The sleep tracker thinks I’m in light sleep when I’m awake and shows I’m awake when I’m sleeping.

Inaccurate data,"have had the “Smart Ring” RingConn for about 2 months.
My first impression is that the ring is well made and
seems to have some sophisticated technology.
Simply put the functions as indicated on the Ring main screen are sleep, Stress,
activity, and heart Rate. It provides a lot of data on each function.
Personally I find the data almost overwhelming and squeezed together.
What I have found, in my brief time, with the Ring is that under Activity, (Steps)
is that they are inaccurate. I have a pedometer and an apple watch and they both
record similar readings in steps taken. Also the ring does not provide distance for
the Steps. If you know how many steps you should know the approximate distance.
The RingConn is way off, on average 200-600 steps. This is unacceptable
and I would think “Skews” the data on other applications on the Ring.
The “Heart rate”(BPM) is also suspect during activity. No clear way to test except by my
Watch and that indicates a discrepancy.
I am disappointed that the Ring does not capture the most basis function of exercise(steps)
in an accurate manner and heart rate.
I did contact RingConn about the steps issue and got a response promptly but
the answer was sort of undefined and in no way an answer to solving the issue.
I have “reset” the Ring several times but that did not change the accuracy of the steps.
I will try it for a little while longer then I will have chalk this up to some devices are
not up to the task.
I would not buy this ring if you expect it to record the basic function of tracking your
Exercise (Steps) or even distance and perhaps heart rate during activity.

Good gadget to track your sleep,"The Ring looks pretty good (obv. not as good as a accessory ring). The Appdesign is good and easy to understand.
It monitors sleep, HR and SpO2 very well. The HRV can only be measured precisely if ur hand is not moving. Accordingly, i don't know how much you can put on the stress index which the ring calculates based on the HRV which can't be recorded accurately during the day with all the movement.
The ring also overestimates the amount of steps taken, which is shown by the difference in steps measured by my phone and by the ring.
Also be aware, that the ring of the sizing kit is (i can only talk about my order) a little smaller than the actual ring.

I bought the ring to monitor my sleep, which is tracked very good, but only 4 stars due to sizing kit not being acurate and the HRV measuring as well as the overestimation of the steps (which for me is not very relevant)",4,2024-10-08T16:34:25.000Z,Joschka Merz,DE,3.0

For this reason, I have stopped wearing my ring 24 hours per day to get a more accurate picture of my sleep hours.

My only other wish would be that there could also be a web-based app rather than just a phone app.

I highly recommend wearing the sizing rings for a couple of days to determine the correct size and finger the RingConn will be worn on. I think the ring works great and the app is easy to use. The only thing I would change is a visual way to determine if the ring is in the correct position.,4,2024-07-22T17:13:46.000Z,Bob Andrick,US,3.0

all the functions are great, ring size I ordered a 7 should ordered an 8 so have ordered another in an 8 & may give the 7 to my daughter when the other arrives.

The measuring for the right size is very problematic you think it would be simple, apparently not...

I was recommended Ring(type) health from my Chiropractor,"I was recommended a Ring(type) health device from my chiropracticor. She has the Oura Ring and has consistently showed me her data and differences when we compare. I prefer the RingConn because of the value, fit, and also I appreciate the data. I think the data, user face, and the notifications can be improved. It is a tad bit cumbersome to navigate and the data while interesting isn't as informative with suggestions, ideas to progress/improve and variable options/suggestions of ""how"" to improve and why. While I fully understand this is not necessarily a health product that supplements professional advice etc. I think the RingConn does have room for improvement in this area. Particularly for those of various levels of fitness, age, and interest in health (whether light go-with-the flow or aggressively trying to improve their health). Overall, the look, fit, and battery-life etc is wonderful.

RingConn works hard for its Customers,"I have been using the ring since its inception, and with messenger we have built a strong community of people who help each other, and RingConn listens to what our concerns are. They are constantly improving the app, and now have had beta testers including me, to help in adding more and more functionality to the ring.

It has really improved in the sleep area immensely. That is why I bought it initially. It gives you a multitude of information about the quality of your sleep and it now adding sleep apnea for those who need it.

Where it needs the most improvement and it is working hard to do that, is tracking your exercise accurately. Whether on a bike or just walking they keep adding more yet the accuracy really still lags in many of those programs.

I can speak to the walking. I am 6' tall and long legged, and I can walk a mile in under 13 minutes, yet a 50 minute walk that my iPhone shows 3.8 miles, their beta app is showing only 2.8 miles quite a difference. The algorythym still needs a lot work, maybe they need to build in your height stride or whatever to get it more accurate, I will leave it to their programmers.

They are always willing to listen and improve, go out and buy this ring, you will not be disappointed!",4,2024-06-26T18:43:50.000Z,Robert Spokane,US,1.0

Bigger Size please,"The RingCoon ring offers good quality and efficient battery management. The accompanying app is straightforward, which is beneficial as it covers all necessary functions without any unnecessary complexity. However, the widgets are redundant since they merely mirror the app's windows; it’s easier to open the app, sync, and check progress directly.

One drawback is the need to send data to the cloud for any results. The phone or app should process basic data locally, with cloud connectivity reserved for more detailed insights. Additionally, push notifications for ring software updates would be helpful. While frequent app usage might be encouraged for data collection, a notification for updates would benefit standard or IT users who sync less frequently.

Moreover, a larger size option would be awesome, as even the size 14 feels a bit small.",4,2024-06-24T21:23:00.000Z,Andrew Smith,HU,1.0

Look, feel, design of the ring, and battery length is fabulous- would highly recommend on these aspects alone.

I have had this for a couple of months now and was eager to have the oxygen and stress readings to keep track of some health issues. Sadly, 90% of the time the ring does not capture readings for many of the metrics, and I still have no understanding of how any of the insights related to stress are gathered. Readings that are captured appear to be off as well- for example ""Stress"" readings and ""exercise mode"" just don't seem to be tracking correctly.",2,2024-06-24T17:27:27.000Z,Jen P,US,1.0

"Good ring, but inaccurate HR readings while training","(Édit): I got the ring shortly after writing the review below. So far, so good. It is not very accurate for measuring the heart rate while training, it consistently measures a heart rate that is much lower than reality (130-140 vs 170bmp). I wish it also measured the skin temperature, but that seems to only work while sleeping for some reason.

For the delay, they did send me the ring protectors to compensate, but honestly, I will never wear these protectors. They are ugly and are a hassle to put on. I would rather put a glove or take the ring off if I feel I could scratch it.

In general I like the product,"In general I like the product. I went through 3 Wellue rings before trying this. It holds the charge as claimed which is amazing. It charges in 90 minutes or less as claimed, also amazing. The water resistant aspect is my most favorite part as I think I lost at least two of the previous brand because of that. I love that it is not bulky and looks like normal jewelry. I find most of the readings accurate when they are taken.

The things I would change if I could. Continuous readings for oxygen and heart rate. For some of us that are chronically ill, it is important to know in lass than 5 minutes if our oxygen drops. Along those lines, notifications when we have readings outside of certain settings. These are huge and frankly, I wouldn’t have bought the ring if I had more clearly understood. If it can send sedentary notifications, it should be able to send others. The sleep recording is way off. I am chronically ill. On really bad days I am sedentary for the better part of the day. The ring records that as sleep - and not just sleep, but deep sleep and REM sleep. This doesn’t seem appropriate.

Good So Far,"So far, my ring has been very good. The sizing and delivery was as advertised. I am very pleased with that. The ring case had a good charge when delivered, and it did not take a lot of time to charge the ring. It was easy to get everything installed, updated and operating. I put it into the case to charge when showering, and it stays close to 100%. But some tweaks are still necessary. The first day I cut the grass with a push mower. This registered as taking a nap. Also, I walk several Km daily and the ""outdoor walking"" selection on the app is not yet active, so my ring has yet to record any exercise. It does count my steps, a bit more freely than my phone pedometer app. Google Fit records my route, not the ring. I have not had any updates since receiving my ring, so I hope these anomalies are corrected. My sleep and other reading appear accurate. It is comfortable to wear.

Great Upgrade to Fitness Watch,"The ring was easy to order and equip, it tracks & displays well, and it is integrated with Google Fit.

Ringconn review,"What I like is the convenience. Put it on and forget about it. Being able to shower with it on is great. Stress and sleep measurements work well. The wellness balance suggestions are helpful. What I don't like is the heart rate and step counter measurements. They both only work correctly when your arm is moving. I work out on a stationary bike. I also wear another heart rate monitor on my arm. My other heart rate monitor will be reading 150 for example, however the ring thinks I'm inactive because I have my arms on the handle bars(not moving). I also don't get any credit for steps because my arm is not moving. So I don't get any credit for the whole workout. If you walk or run for exercise the ring is great. I also use a push mower to mow grass on a slopping lot. It is a great workout!! But my heart rate according to the ring will stay around 70 because my arms are on the mower handle(not moving). I also don't get any credit for steps for the same reason(arms not moving). If I take my arm off the bike or mower, the heart rate and steps are correct. Mowing and biking one handed is difficult and not sustainable. I do manage to reach my step goals, but I have to do extra walking or running to achieve it. I really do like the ring. I hope a firmware update will fix these issues.",3,2024-06-19T20:14:11.000Z,Michael Vaughn,US,1.0

Satisfaction Despite Challenges,"Review: Satisfaction Despite Challenges**

I had the pleasure of working with Isla as my guide, and I want to share my positive experience. Isla was always there for me and constantly provided guidance, even when there were issues with the delivery.

Let me detail my experience:

1. **Service**: The overall service was very good. Email response times were excellent, and I always felt well supported and informed.

2. **Delivery**: Delivery was challenging. It took significantly longer than I expected. Personally, I believe this should be communicated more clearly, as I couldn't find any information about the extended delivery times anywhere.

3. **Returns**: Returning items incurs a fee, which is understandable, but it would have been helpful to know this in advance.

4. **Ringconn Gadget App**: The app has room for improvement, from my perspective. More customer data might be needed to further optimize it.

5. **Overall Picture**: Despite some challenges, I'm overall satisfied with the experience. Isla's assistance played a significant role in this.

6. **Appreciation**: Dear Isla, you are the best. Thank you for your tireless efforts and excellent support.

Overall, I had a positive experience and can recommend the service—especially thanks to Isla.",5,2024-06-21T05:00:26.000Z,Cristian Belacurencu,DE,7.0

One of the best rings on the market.,"The app and ring connect together pretty well, and I haven’t seen any connection issues that aren’t resolved with a quick restart of the app. Sleep, stress and BPM/SP02 data is nicely laid out and the implications of the numbers are easy to understand. Not having to pay a subscription fee for the app is also a definite plus.
That said, it would be nice to partition sleep data over a single sleep period if possible. For example, if I go to sleep at 11 PM, wake up at 2 AM, and go back to sleep from 4 AM to 6 AM, the ring counts this as one continuous block of sleep from 11 - 6, which makes data inaccurate.",4,2024-06-14T00:55:55.000Z,Clayton Fernandes,US,1.0

Initially they wouldn't send the correct ring I wanted until they received it back in HK but after some pushing they conceded and shipped the correct ring. Again it took about 10 days. Overall from date of order to receiving the correct ring was 24 days which is disappointing but Customer service were communicative and overwhelmingly apologetic for the error which is appreciated when things do go wrong. Initial use of the ring and the app for 5 days is good so far.",4,2024-06-10T01:01:08.000Z,David,NZ,2.0
A very smart - smart ring,Very good order process. Ring sizer arrived quickly as did the ring once the size was confirmed. Quick and accurate tracking information and very pleased with the smart ring. Battery 6 days. Stats very interesting and accurate with easy link with Google Fit.

UPDATED,I ordered my boyfriend a RingConn because it’s seems like a pretty cool idea. I ordered it on 05/18 and got it 05/25. BUT I need to exchange the ring for a different size and it has been the WORST process ever. I have emailed them twice so far and called once (I wasn’t able to reach anyone at their number for 20 minutes then got a voicemail and left a message) still no response. I’ll update this review once they respond if they ever do but it sucks that you pay $300 and get NO communication if there are issues. It really seems like they don’t care about employee experience at all. If this continues I’ll just ask for a refund back but would not recommend it at all. Ours has much better customer service. UPDATE! They have assisted me in getting a replacement ring and were quite helpful. They suggested shipping a sizing thing but we knew the correct size so they just send us the ring and it even came quicker than the original ring. Thanks so much for your help Ringconn!,4,2024-06-08T16:46:42.000Z,Amal Rudwan,US,1.0
RingConn has a long way to go to bring their customer service up to par,"So far the ring performs as advertised. I wish I could give it a better rating but the issues I had with customer service overshadowed the experience in ways I won’t soon forget.

My ring was lost in shipping and the support group at RingConn was slow, unhelpful and condescending in handling my issue. After many messages to support and responses that were days late or failed to address my issue, RingConn finally agreed to ship me a new ring. I requested overnight shipment to make up for the lost time and frustration I experienced and they disregarded my request completely, instead sending a new ring three days later via USPS. They repeatedly disregarded my request to have a supervisor contact me.

Several days later I received two rings on consecutive days. No sooner had the second ring arrived than I began getting urgent messages from RingConn to return it. They asked me to take it to a shipping location which I refused to do. I used a shipping label they provided and left it out for my postman to pick up.

I have rarely experienced such incompetent service nor have I been disregarded as completely as I was by RingConn. I was far more diligent in sending back the second ring than they were in addressing my concerns. I only hope I don’t have an issue with the ring, since I have no confidence RingConn will stand behind their product.

Follow up 05/27/2024:
I received a lengthy response from RingConn after posting my review. Like all their communications, it was vague and did not address my concerns. I have dealt with online sellers of many products for decades and have never been treated so disrespectfully. I've wasted enough time on this.

Customer service TERRIBLE,"I got my ring a little over a month ago. It stopped holding a charge already. You submit your concern through the app, but it usually takes 2 days for them to get back to you. They said that they would send me a return label two days ago, all I needed to do was confirm my address and that I am ready to mail it. I confirmed, but then they e-mail back today asking me to confirm my ring size (so I'm sure they won't get back to me for another 2 days). It just seems they drag things out quite a bit. I haven't been able to use my ring for 10 days - and will be much longer at the rate of their customer service.

Update June 2: Due to the poor customer service, I requested a refund. On May 22, they said my refund was of “utmost importance” and that they would be following it “very closely”. They said I should get it in 2-3 business days. But after 7 business days, I still have yet to receive my refund.

Quite honestly - the customer service (or lack thereof) should be enough to discourage anyone from purchasing this ring.",1,2024-06-03T17:44:02.000Z,Tonya Headlee,US,1.0
"after two months, here is my opinion on RingConn","The products really impressed me for many reasons :
1- The price of $279 is a KILLER!!

SO2 function and sleep function incorrect,The purchase etc went fine. But having used it now I find that the SO2 measurement on the ring during sleep has changed to a much lower reading. I check with another gadget I have and that I know meets medical standards and that one shows antwo point higher average. More or less what I had when I started using the ring. Ni don’t know what changed but this basically makes the ring useless for me as I had bought it specifically to measure that. Also two nights ago I barely slept and was awake most of the night. I got a 96 score on my sleep which is even higher than nights where I know the sleep was mixed. I would like to return my ring and get a refund. The ring was purchased 5 months ago and I use it typically only at night although I have now had it on for a full week,1,2024-05-06T08:11:47.000Z,Susanne,AT,2.0
Loving the Ring,"I've had several smart watches, but I hate wearing a watch so I just didn't bother and they just never really felt accurate. I finally switched to Ring and absolutely love it. It's out of the way, decorative, but not blingy, and it works. I feel the step counts are far more accurate, the sleep stuff is fascinating and enlightening, heart rate, oxygen, and all that are easy to read. I'm most enjoying the Stress sensor, I love to drive but the Ring has shown me how stressed I am while driving. I can see it now, but I had no idea at the time.

Latest App Update a Disaster.,"For several months I found the ring to be very helpful in analyzing my sleep. The data provided me with a chart of my sleep stages during the night. Within the past few weeks however the app was ""updated"" and I no longer have access to the sleep data chart, only a single number, telling me my total sleep for the night. No more data telling me the amount of light sleep. deep sleep, and REM sleep. I sent in a request to have the problem fixed but the reply was totally unsatisfactory, telling me it would be fixed with the next upgrade. That might be months, if at all. I bought the ring based on the data presentation that I was initially provided, not on the very abbreviated presentation I now have. I have no idea why the company would take such a huge step backward. I did not buy the ring based on the skimpy data that is now provided. I have no choice but to demand a return of my money.",1,2024-05-04T22:27:05.000Z,Dennis Jones,US,3.0

I'm disappointed with the sizing kit and the customer service. I wore the size 9 and the size 10 sample rings for 2 weeks on my index finger and ordered a size 10 in silver. When I got my actual ring, it was way too big for my index finger and kept sliding off. I reached out to the company to see if I could return it for a size 9 (I did know that all sales are final, but I explained that the ring wasn't the same size as the sizing ring) and was told no and to try a different finger. I do wear my ring on my middle finger because the ring wasn't cheap, but it looks awful!

My experiences after half a year of use,"The ring is almost unnoticeable. The ring battery lasts 6 days. The charging box also includes a battery and you can charge the ring in the box several times before you have to charge the box's battery. Ideal if you are traveling without electricity for several weeks. The ring has integrated memory and does not have to be permanently connected to the cell phone. When the connection is restored, the measurement data is sent to the cell phone and the cloud. The app is very clear and easy to understand. The positive thing is that it doesn't require a subscription and the app is therefore free. The app is available in multiple languages and Ring Conn is constantly working to improve the app. You can actively start measurements yourself in the app. Ring Conn Support always strives to provide a solution to questions as quickly as possible. I can recommend this product with a clear conscience. I hope I was able to answer a few questions for those interested in the recession.

6-months review…,"I’ve had my RingConn ring for exactly 6 months now. It has given very reliable results over this time period with no significant problems, particularly helping me track sleep and steps. The step-tracking feature has definitely been a helpful motivator in getting me active most every day. Although I did need to learn exactly how it was measuring ‘steps’ - which was not the number of times my feet touched the ground, but was actually the number of times my arms would swing freely as I walked. For instance I did need to learn to carry my grocery bag with my right hand in the store and let my left (ring) hand swing freely, if I wanted my shopping walking to count. But it’s basically been an extremely effective - and also very unobtrusive - device for helping me monitor these health & wellness functions.",5,2024-04-24T22:17:56.000Z,Roger Byrd,US,1.0

Happy but missing activity tracking,The ring is comfortable and I like it more than wearing a smart watch.

RingConn the best smart ring with no subscription,"Had ring from early days in Feb 2023 14 months on and this ring is fantastic - there are regular updates in app and firmware each one creating a better experience.

Also this ring has No Subscription which I love, all updates free

Found the vitals/ Heart Rate - HRV-Spo2 oxygen Sleep to be extremely accurate when testing against other equipment I have.
Sleep Apnea is under testing as is fertility tracking as I write this review

Overall this ring has made a massive difference how I track my health- don’t use Apple Watch for that anymore - no more bulky watch at night for sleep tracking- each day i track my vitals to see how I’m doing,

Love the customer care team and feedback team - very proactive - they have a great group where everyone asks questions and give their views and RingConn interact directly with people in group on Facebook

Overall 5 stars - love the ring and regular updates wether young and healthy for sports tracking or older like myself - I find this ring a great asset for tracking my health - well done RingConn for being proactive in developing this ring and keeping on top-with regular updates

A great concept that could use improvements,"1- the lack of half sizes was a problem for me. I had to choose either a ring that was too tight or two loose. When I contacted the company for help, they were very noncommittal, basically telling me that neither would be a good idea. Well, duh. I ultimately decided on too loose because I still wanted to be able to get the ring off if I was bloated or on a hot day. That resulted in nearly losing the ring a couple of times on very cold days because it fell right off my finger! I finally solved this by purchasing a very thin, cheap ring in my size from Amazon which I wear on top of my RingConn to keep it from falling off.

2- the Wellness Balance is not explained clearly. I check it, but other than my sleep & activity, it's not really intuitive what information I'm getting from my vital signs & stress scores. More info would be more helpful.

3- they started giving wellness badges. Ok. Cool. What exactly am I tracking?

4- I pretty much use this to track my steps. It's a lot more comfortable than an apple watch.

5- I do appreciate being able to use the app without a subscription, which is why I chose this over another ring on the market.

Bottom line- I like it. But I can't say I love it. It's a great concept that could use some improvements.",3,2024-04-19T17:15:46.000Z,Beth B,US,2.0

Amazing ring with a amazing app,"I've had the ring for ≈5 months now and so far I'm very happy with it.

The app is updated very frequently with new features being added. Since I got the ring there has been an updated summary as well as new features to tack outdoor running.

All my contact with the company has been really great as well. I order the protector and received a size small er than I ordered. They quickly corrected their mistake and I got 2 new protector of the correct size a few days later. I even were able to change the size after having submitted a smaller size than I actually wanted.

The ring itself is very nice and both feels and looks great. It's very comfortable to wear and I usually forget that I'm even wearing it. It's great at tracking sleep and over-all activity. Although the downside is that it's quite inaccurate when working out in a gym and the heart rate seems to be far off.

Finally thank you for an affordable option!",4,2024-04-17T21:37:00.000Z,Maria,US,1.0

So Far So Good,"My Ring experience has been good so far. I have had my Ring about 5 or 6 months. Fit and delivery were fast and easy. The quality of the ring itself is good and the brushed aluminum finish is nice, subtle and does not scratch very easily. The ring charges quickly and is easy to do using their included pod style charger. I wish syncing was a bit faster or even bet automatic each day. The FREE app is a nice touch for following your information. It is well laid out and easy to read and understand after just a few uses. There have been a continuous stream of updates to the app and ring so that has been a nice upside. Kudos to the dev team! Overall I am very happy with my purchase. My one piece of advice (no matter what ring you purchase is to decide what you are really looking to get out of the information they provide and will you use it to make informed decisions). I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could as it's not perfect but pretty great overall.",4,2024-04-17T19:57:12.000Z,Matt,US,3.0
I love my RingConn ring!,"I love my ring! (silver color)
Keeps me aware of my stress level, if I'm getting enough sleep or need to focus more on it, steps, consistency, etc. Does exactly what I wanted it to do. I really like wearing all of my rings, (I have many in stainless steel and sterling silver and it blends well with all of them. I constantly get compliments on my rings and they have no idea that one of them is a health tracker until I mention it...IF I do! Lol) so this is a perfect health tracker for me, vs. wrist versions, that I've also had easily break or wear out on me, so I LOVE this option and even more so since they aren't just trying to take advantage with yet another monthly subscription!!!

I like the ring overall,"I like the ring overall. It seems to be well built and durable.

I’ve gone through the steps on your support page to remedy the problem, but I haven’t had any success.

At this juncture, the only recommendation I can offer is to fix what I mentioned above and allow the customer the choice to set whether or not they want to receive a daily summary of how they slept the night before. The notification can say something like, “here is your sleep summary from last night.” I often forget to check my dashboard in the morning because I’m busy getting ready for my day. Consequently, I don’t check it until later or forget altogether. Other than that, I think you have a great product, and it is performing as expected.

Neurodivergent helpful - detailed sleep and stress,"The ring is crafted well and never feels too warm or tight/loose with the two bumps, which was something I was worried about before owning it.

What sold me on this ring and why I'm still very happy with it is that I'm a neurodivergent person that struggles with things like severe ADHD and a very common comorbidity of that, Insomnia.

Having a ring that accurately tracks whenever you sleep no matter the time and understands and displays sleep stages has been so useful for me to track and understand so much more about my sleep needs and patterns. Including learning I have my most efficient and restful sleeps with the best ratio of Deep and REM sleep stages when I sleep between 5-6 hours vs more/less hours.

It also tracks stress levels very well that compares and outdoes what my apple watches did for me in the past. But on a ring on my finger instead of a watch that has a poor battery.

It is also been surprisingly durable and waterproof to where I can just forget it is on. I do tend to take it off to charge while I shower, but it's not due to not being able to shower with it on, I just found that to be the most convenient and efficient way to keep my ring charged without interrupting my schedule.

I had issues with my ring not keeping charge more than 3 days after 2 months of use and they without hesitation mailed me a replacement to use within the same week. This second one has kept its charge same as when I first got it and lasts 7 days but I charge mine more often as mentioned so i rarely have to push it unless I just forget to take it off when I shower.

Speaking of the case, it is just great. I rarely ever have to plug in the case to charge. Maybe once a month, or longer?

Very very happy with it. Only improvements I want to see more of is just more features on the app but those are already promised and even within the time of purchasing it until now there have already been new features and bug fixes added routinely which is always a good sign of a healthy app development cycle and a team that is organized and follows agile methodology. (I'm a software engineer, so it's easier to spot 😅).

For the price this is such a good investment for me and I'm happy to have jumped onto the ringconn bandwagon over the others I had researched in comparison.

"Pretty good ring, but swelling of finger a major issue","My RingConn ring has been an interesting experience. I purchased this as part of a Black Friday sale. I needed a ring sizing kit, and this was sent to me, although I felt it was dispatched and delivered a bit slowly. I decided on a ring size after wearing the ""sizing"" ring a couple of days. I wanted the ring to be worn on my non-dominant hand. The ring arrived in a reasonable time after I selected the ring size online. It charged up properly. The set up was okay, but I did feel that RingConn's app was asking for too much personal information such as my home address. It should be asking only for the rock bottom minimum information from the user. My home address is not needed for a health tracking application.

After a time, it became clear to me that the RingConn app installed on my iPhone was rather basic, but it seemed to be sending my health data to a server somewhere on the internet. For example, to get a report of my health data (such as the stress score, sleep trends, step counts) over time, the information appears to be made available from a server. I have no idea if this information is encrypted on the remote server(s) or not and what other parties have access to my personal data...such as my daily sleep patterns.

Even so, for a almost 4 months, it was fun to wear my ring daily, 24 hours a day, except in the shower or when doing some messy chores with my hands like washing dishes. It was fun seeing the trends develop over time. But then, quite recently, a problem developed. The finger that I used for my ring seemed to start swelling. I could not get the ring off easily. Perhaps this is tied to increasing physical activity on my part, or warmer temperatures as the short winter ended and Spring arrived. I am not sure. My skin came off a bit the last time I wrenched the ring off my finger...not a lot of skin...and there was really almost no pain...but there was some minor bleeding that stopped quickly. I decided I had better stop wearing the ring. Recently, my finger has healed enough to put the ring back on, but the fit is so tight that I'm afraid I'll injure the finger again when I need the ring to come off.

So I'm not sure what to do. I wish I could have ordered a quarter-size larger (for example, ring size 9.25 instead of 9) or a half-size larger (as in 9.50.) I have given the ring to my wife, since she is interested in RingConn.

I think that eventually, health tracking rings need to be constructed from flexible materials that can accept some amount of physical expansion or contraction. I think ring materials that are flexible in this way are very necessary for me. I don't understand why my finger swelled, and perhaps it will contract this coming winter with cooler temperatures. But the ring is useless to me if it cannot fit on my finger ""just right"".

Also, it is important for customers to feel that their personal information is safe; that it will not be sold to third parties for any reason; that it is secured such that even RingConn employees cannot decrypt someone's personal information; that it cannot be decrypted by third parties; and that even if the data is stolen by thieves, it cannot be decrypted by them, either (even if the thieves wait a few years and try to decrypt at that future date.)

Overall, I like the idea of a health tracking ring, but the materials need to be improved and the security of my personal data really needs to be assured.",2,2024-04-17T03:58:37.000Z,Bob Cochran,US,6.0

Happy/Sad,"Hello;
Firstly, my experience with the ring was nothing short of great. The metrics it accumulated were very precise. The sad part of this journey is that I lost the ring on a jobsite. It fit wonderfully, though I believe I lost it in a clients heated floor. It has been a month and a bit since it's been lost, and I am struggling with the decision if I will replace it. I tried a silicone cover, but they degraded quickly. I would also suggest a 'find function' on the ring (similar to the find my phone app).

"A few minor changes, and it's a 5-star ring.","The Ringconn's extended battery life is an advantage. However, the feature set could benefit from further enhancement. It lacks distinctive features that differentiate it from competitors. Still, the absence of a subscription requirement was a compelling factor in my initial selection of Ringconn as an introduction to smart rings. But, the limited functionality is prompting me to consider alternative options, as it does not fully replace any of my other devices or even limit how much I use them. I would give it five stars if it tracked workouts and shared data with Nike, Samsung, Apple, or other major fitness trackers and somehow notified me of missed calls and texts from specific contacts.

I got the Ring for my spouse,I got the Ring for my spouse. And he told me that after the last software update he nologer gets notifications on when the Ring needs to be charged. The pulse ox is inaccurate. Becasue he has a medical one here and the request we got the Ring was so that way it can Bluetooth to his CPAP. Which it does not. And that's on the CPAP side but the inaccuracy is correct because he won't be able to breath and it's reading him at 95% but put theat home one on and he's at 88%. Maybe a software issue. Other than that everything else is ok. It logs sleep and heart rate excellent and accurate. Including when he takes a nap. Hopefully the next update can get these glitches fixed and a collaboration with all the CPAP machines with Bluetooth will a actually beable to use that function because this really is to monitor he o2 levels while he's sleeping or out and about.,4,2024-04-12T01:16:35.000Z,Benjamin Mashek,US,1.0

Do your research to find the best ring for you. This one is a winner for me!,"I did a lot of research in finding the smart ring that would work best for me. I decided on the RingConn ring because of the style, color choices and information the RingConn app would provide me. I also didn't want to pay for a subscription service just to use the ring. Before ordering the ring, I was sent a ring size kit. The kit is amazing. It provides enough physical ring sizes to meet everyone's needs. Try one on for 24 hrs and see what fits best before ordering. The ring does exactly what RingConn says it does and does not do. I take a shower with it, sleep with it, along with exercise. The app information has helped me with several changes in my life. From my sleep habits to exercise.

I was a bit apprehensive about the quality ( as it was the less expensive version of the ones on the market) but I’m more than impressed with the accuracy, quality and ease of use.

I would say the delivery times could use some improvement, it took almost 4 weeks to receive the Ring sizing kit, had another week to receive the actual Ring itself. I also wish they had a polished version, I have the silver one, and it looks quite dull compared to my other jewellery, however that’s quite an petty observation, given the functionality of the unit.

I love the sleep tracking, it’s really helped me to actively improve the quality of my sleep. I’ve noticed a direct correlation between the number of steps I get each day and the quality of my sleep and HRV.

I give four stars because the application still needs to develop some functionalities, for example different types of exercises.

Difficult for big hands,The ring is somewhat uncomfortable to wire especially when grasping door nobs etc. While ringconn has the best selection of sizes large hands are left out just like the competition. This was the only manufacturer whose ring would fit my right hand ring finger vice index finger which would have more comfortable to wear. I like the battery lasting seven days mostly. Charging is very easy and fast. It would be handy to have a visible way to know the ring is in right position when worn. I currently use a dab of finger nail polish so I can quickly verify the rings position. The price of the ring is fair.

This is the fitness ring to get,"After exhaustively researching the”Big 4” names in fitness rings (Oura, Circular, Ultrahuman and RingConn), I chose RingConn. RingConn was less expensive, had a lot of excellent (and believable) reviews and, perhaps most importantly, has NO MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION/EXTORTION FEE (which other companies should be absolutely ashamed to charge for such an expensive product). The RingConn ring isn’t quite as nice-looking as some of the others, but it looks absolutely fine, so I have no regrets on that front.

I’ve been wearing the ring for 2+ months. It took a few days for the ring to “get to know” me and provide what appeared to be accurate data, but it has been rock-steady and excellent ever since. The results are consistent with (and I think more accurate than) my Galaxy Watch’s sleep data. (The only thing which confuses both my RingConn and my Galaxy watch is my bed’s vibrating massage function; using it typically results in inaccurate sleep data.). The RingConn app provides detailed information, but is very user-friendly and easy to understand. The few times I found errors in the data (which turned out to be caused by the bed’s massage function), I submitted a ticket through the app and received a satisfactory response within a day. The charging box is the best charging system of any ring; it is super-convenient and works flawlessly. I typically charge the ring every few days while I take a shower just because that’s convenient, but based on the battery level readings in the app, one charge would last 6-7 days.

I’m glad I did so much research before choosing RingConn. This brand seem to be the underdog of fitness rings at the moment, but I would not be surprised if they end up the leader. IMHO, RingConn’s product design, accuracy, price, customer service and pay-once model leave the others in the dust.",5,2024-03-29T21:15:06.000Z,Michael in California,US,2.0

It seems to make the data up,"Initially all seemed well. Long wait to receive the ring during the Kickstarter campaign, but the company tried to keep people updated, even though their own spreadsheet didn't match up with delivery volumes and dates.
After wearing the ring for a few months, I've been receiving worrying heart rate data of very high heart rate. These figures didn't match up at all with a smart watch readings, or an external blood pressure monitor.
Heart rate around 60bpm, ring sometimes records resting heart rate 170-220bpm. During these high heart rate recording other devices track a higher heart rate of 80-100bpm, but no where near the figures RingConn records. And these are not brief blips of a minute or two, but 30-60 minute periods.
I have contacted RingConn on a few occasions, sending them data showing the high reading and just receive a standard copy and paste reply, basically fobbing me off, saying they are aware of high heart rate readings and updating software/algorithms to correct the issue, which never seems to happen.
As for the rest of the data the ring provides, the sleep figures can be way off as well, which is the only other metric I can verify. And as I've got no way of checking the rest of the data, I've got no way of confirming how accurate it is.
RingConn keep updating the design of the app, which is pointless if the data it shows isn't accurate.
Basically, don't buy a RingConn ring, it'll be money wasted.",1,2023-12-23T05:19:41.000Z,Phil,GB,25.0

"Quick delivery, easy to set up, and accurate Bio ring","I researched this ring and others before settling on the Ringconn, primarily because there is no recurring cost. I found the analytics to be similar with more costly rings. I ordered the ring sizing kit on Nov.20. The kit was delivered on Nov. 27. I submitted my ring size on Nov. 28, and received my ring on Dec. 11. The ring is simple to set up and I compared the Ringconn analytics with some of my other heath monitoring systems and the Ringconn is accurate, and looks good as well.",5,2023-12-13T17:06:13.000Z,Steve Heath,US,3.0
I went from a fitbit to Oura and now to…,"I went from a fitbit to Oura and now to Ring Conn, very very happy!! It has the step accuracy of fitbit, Oura is not even close to being an accurate step counter. This ring automatically recognizes exercise and then rates the level of exercise accurately! Plus, you can't just add a workout and cheat this setup, it knows when your working out. With fitbit or Oura you can manually add the workout which then inflates your heart rate and gives you workout credit whether you actually worked out or not?? Oura is slow to recognize stress, this ring is spot on all the time! This is the only ring that gives you 24hr automatic heart rate, spo2 and hrv readings all the time that is super accurate and then gives you an ongoing average all day and night of those metrics! Come on everyone, please realize your HRV is the epicenter of all of your workout or just normal recovery from anything your doing! This ring nails it even when compared to my chest strap that measures my HRV and I can see it at a glance anytime, wherever I am! The information pages are like no other app with ongoing averages to all your other metrics and a trend format like no other. I am surprised there is no monthly charge for this app. I bought the silver and it is a beautiful ring, matte finish in the center to a polished surface on the edges, very durable too. If I listened to all the marketing bs comparing this ring to the others, I might not have bought this ring, just buy it and enjoy, it is truly the best!!",5,2023-12-12T00:25:26.000Z,Brian,US,1.0

Very Dissatisfied Customer,"I ordered a ring from RingConn after researching many different ones. I did not pick the ""I don't know my size"" as I have a ring sizer at home and I know my ring size. However, once I received my ring and wore it for 3 days my 2nd knuckle on my pointer finger was sore and bruised; however the ring itself fit. I have long skinny fingers so the width of the ring takes up the entire area from the end of my finger where it touches my hand to the 2nd knuckle (I ordered the ring to fit both index fingers along with both pointer fingers). I have 2 autoimmune disorders that affect my joints and cause pain so sometimes I am unsure how something with affect my skin, joints, and be comfortable for me until I get and wear it. This happened once I wore the ring. I emailed the RingConn less than a week of receiving and wearing the ring explaining the situation and was told my circumstance does not allow for returns and I could either continue to wear it (even though I told them it is painful and causing bruises) or I could gift it to someone. So, I am now going to be out the money the ring cost along with having to purchase another tracker of some kind. I received absolutely no assistance from the company whatsoever. I do understand that I chose the the ring size and like I said it does fit but there are things that I cannot always plan for with having autoimmune disorders which is partly the reason why I chose their product as it would track some health measures I needed and wanted.",1,2023-11-06T21:05:33.000Z,Morgan Wall,US,1.0

Very Satisfied User,"I have been using my RingConn for about a month now and it has been very helpful in monitoring my health. I purchased it specifically for the sleep tracking since I can’t stand to wear my bulky Apple Watch to sleep. The sleep tracking data is very thorough and complete and gives a score every night on the quality of your sleep which I find helpful at a glance to see how it went. As far as the fitness tracking and heart rate I wear both ring and watch during the day and both get the same (or very similar) results so I believe that the fitness data the ring collects is pretty accurate. I have a friend with the Oura ring and have compared data with them and the RingConn records the same data without the need for a paid subscription which is a great feature. Also I think that the RingConn’s detailed sleep data is more inclusive than what the Oura is able to provide. Overall I’m very happy with my ring and I find it so easy to wear I forget it’s there!

Just an FYI the shipping takes a very long time to arrive but that’s ok I was able to communicate with support and was reassured that it was on the way and not lost.",5,2023-10-03T17:32:18.000Z,Leia Sweetman,US,1.0

Brilliant health monitoring device,"Have loved this ring from moment I started wearing it.
Love all the features, it's comfortable and gives me so much information.
Longest part of the process was receiving the sizing kit, but actusl ring arrived within a few days.
Started using it straight away. I have a Samsung phone and it has paired nicely. I have a Samsung smart watch and a Tag one and have to say the ring is hands down better!
There are no monthly fees like some others, which made me favour this particular one after a lot of research, and I'm glad I did. The app that links the ring to your phone is probably one of the best apps around, the battery is superb and my ring lasts almost a full week before I have to recharge it... then it fully recharges within about 1 hour in the lovely wee case it came in.
My daily summary gives me not only sleep and stress info by each hour but also gives me my activity and steps. It compares day to day for activity, stress, sleep, heart rate, and activity calories plus more.
I am a real tech gadget person and this genuinely is one of the best products around for monitoring your health.

The BEST health tracking ring,"This company shows searious business with not only producing a high quality health tracking ring WITHOUT subscription and they have the best, friendliest and fastest responding costumer service.

The ring have a exclusive, great design and doesn't only look good, if feels comfortable to wear.
And it's the only ring on the market that comes with a charging case that holds 18 charges to the ring. And the ring have a battery that lasts for 7 days. How about that ?

After ordering the ring you'll be sent a sizing kit so you can determin your size and color of choise and when RingConn gets your order the ring will be sent to you in a premium presentation box.

Health tracking ring,"The thing I love most about my RingConn ring is that it doesn't look like a tech device, it simply looks good.
On top of that it's very light and I don't feel that it's on my finger. The brushed gold looks beautiful.

Great that there is no monthly fee to get access to your data.

The ring is water resistant and I don't have to worry washing hands, doing dishes, showering, swimming or jumping in sea.

The RingConn app is very intuitive to use. And the company is constantly working on new features to implement. They have made some changes to the app so it's more functional.

I love the activity/daily calories & step count. It helps to see how active you need to be to maintain or lose weight.
The sleep tracking is very accurate and so is the heartrate and stress score tracking. (Compared to other wearables and medical equipement)
Bonus is the sleep temp.

The company is constantly updating the app and the RingConn firmware.
Making positive changes to help improve the product so it gets to be even better. They actually listen to their users. There have been several positive changes since I started using my ring about 4 months ago.

Ringconn rings are great,"I made a purchase in January of my very own ringconn ring. The app has been a great work in progress. We find a bug, they fix it.

The astetics of the ring
The ring simply looks great. There is comfort and quality to put into the ring and makes me feel like they care about the product. They keep releasing the accessories and seem to put a lot of thought into them as well. I am so pleased with this product.

Cost.
At 279.00 it's a great deal. The other companies in the ring market are about the same price but don't offer the same matrix. They also (some) charge a monthly fee. The ringconn company has said a number of times they will not have a monthly fee, and they haven't.

Phantastic,"Well, I am an early supporter of the idea, loving that subscription free solution.

I am usually wearing mechanical watches only, thus the ring supposed to be my device.

Update: the ring came right before the holiday season and is now in constant use, on the beach (salty atlantico), sweet water pool and on all other occasions.

I have been a bit skeptical lately after seeing the offer of a silicon protection cover; that maybe sand could damage the surface, scratching and so on.

Well, I have ordered the protecting ring but so far I don't have any complaints, even though the ring faces tough conditions, heat, sun, salt water etc..

I am very happy about the data the ring provides, data enabling me to have objective insights into (body/health) facts instead of feelings.

Beside the insights (and data means power in regard to our core asset, life), the ring looks stunning and can be worn without having a smartphone nearby as data will be synced later on.

Well, that's one of the best purchases I have ever made and it's going to boost knowledge about my body and supports me on my way to take even better care of myself, for me and my loved once.

Finally a serious contender in the health ring arena,"I just received my order of a gorgeous black RingConn and I have to say how impressed I am with the quality of work that has gone into creating this ring. From its packaging to functionality, fit and esthetics, this health tracking ring beats the front runner in this field, hands down. For example it can measure blood SpO2 saturation index continuously 24/7, something that even the Oura ring can not do without draining the battery and talk about battery, I just LOVE the charging box that comes with it, a subtle (and functional) addition that no other similar smart ring, has. The ring charges from almost no charge, within an hour or so and the charge lasts for a good 6-7 days.
The app is also a work of art and packed with live and historical health data and other information. You can just tell that a massive amount of work has gone into creating RingConn app alone.
RingConn also has built in temperature sensors and will soon activate the feature with an app update to measure core body temperature too. It currently only measures ""Skin Temperature""during sleep, and again another feature that Oura doesn't have.
As for accuracy, I have checked the SpO2 and Sleep data against my medical grade Oximeter and my ZEO EKG device. The results are within 2% of each other. In contrast my Oura Ring results are within a 6% margin of error which makes the RingConn an undisputed winner in accuracy, as far as I am concerned.
I would definitely recommend it.",5,2023-08-21T05:05:54.000Z,Siamak Manzarpour,CA,1.0

I was in the original purchase group of…,"I was in the original purchase group of RingConn. My first experiences with the ring were fantastic, much better than Oura. The HRV was all day and not just during sleep and it was accurate. The step counter was also accurate. The heart rate was not only accurate but continuous.

Then the ring simply stopped working. One night I woke up and there was no sleep data and no HRV data. This happened multiple times. I wrote to the company and received back a message obviously written by somebody who didn't speak English very well. Because I've had the ring for a few months, I cannot get my money back. So I put the Oura ring back on my finger and chalked this up to the normal fraud mongers who are out there looking to take our money.

Caveat emptor: Be careful of this company. Once a tracking device misses one day there is never a reason to wear it again. This ring has possibilities but isn't ready for prime time. Expect it to stop working and then expect customer service to write you back and talk to you like English is their sixth language.",2,2023-06-18T00:16:24.000Z,Squire Law Group P.A.,US,1.0

RingConn is much better than Oura,"I have been wearing RingConn for a week now. I really like this!

I had Oura before. I have to admit that Oura is good for sleep tracking but 7$ in a month for subscription fee is too much. As a matter of principle i unsubscribed and i also sold my Oura.

I can compare RingConn sleep tracking to my Apple watch. I have to say that i believe RingConn more than Apple watch.

RingConn steps calcularor is working too. You can see walking distance. Oura’s steps wasnt working. I also like RingConn’s stress monitoring and also all the other features too. I dont miss Oura at all.

Some users complaining about scratches. Well… my Oura got so scratched that they changed my ring (warranty). Of course these can get scratches in hard use like phones watches etc. You can use wrap paper or something if you like to cover your ring.

Somebody said that Facebook admin and community are toxic. Well.. my experience is the opposite. Community helps each other and admins are there too. They also help people with their problems. I sent email to RingConn and they replied at the same day.

Overall:
I really recommend RingConn. Better looking than Oura. These guys updating app/ring and i have a feeling that they take this project seriously. Even more features than Oura (example stress monitoring). No monthly subscription fee and also RingConn is cheaper than Oura.",5,2023-04-27T23:14:36.000Z,Frankie L,FI,1.0

They are in China. As such a company your data belongs to the PRC. They have curated reviews and responses in social media to further deceive buyers.

Very Pleased!,"I was one of the first 20 backers of this IndieGoGo kickstarter campaign and have no regrets whatsoever. Received my sizing kit and ultimately my ring in the timeframe promised by RingConn. This company is EXTREMELY proactive and the communication with their backers has been EXTRAORDINARY.

The app software and ring firmware are works in progress, however, I’m not a fussy person as I see RingConn putting a lot of time and effort into development.

Sadly, the negative reviews on here are ridiculous at best with RingConn not deserving the negativity as they’ve been ALWAYS upfront and transparent with their backer unlike any other kickstarter campaign I know of.

My experience has been positive and some of the data has been extremely accurate but also know with this first generation ring that it will get better over time. What people need to know is smartwatches and smart rings are NOT medical devices but are excellent for baseline numbers only.",5,2023-04-15T17:56:48.000Z,MsKathy,US,3.0

Really an amazing wearable health device,"From the moment I got this amazing ring I have loved it. Right now I struggle with stress and sleep, so I decided on this ring. I have an Apple watch but it does not give me as much information as this ring. There are no monthly fees like some those other rings have. The app that links the ring to your phone is probably one of the best apps around. My ring lasts almost a full week before I have to recharge it. And it only takes about an hour to get it fully recharged. I received my ring in February so I have been wearing it every day since. Honestly, I don't even wear my Apple watch anymore since I got this ring. It gives me so much info on the times in the day my stress level rises so I can try to control those times better. I really like all of the information it gives me about what my heart and breath rhythms are doing throughout the night. My daily summary gives me not only my sleep and stress info by each hour in also gives me my activity and steps. It compares my day to day for activity, stress, sleep, heart rate, and activity calories plus more. This is really one of the best products around for monitoring your health. I love this ring so much I bought one for my husband.",5,2023-04-15T17:52:45.000Z,Dae\r Williams,US,3.0

Best smart ring on the market!!,"This ring works, unlike some others out there. RingConn came to crowdfunding ready to deliver and they have. I had another ring briefly and despite being a market leader, I had horrible customer service from them and had to send that ring back.
This ring is absolutely amazing. Yes it's a startup company, yes this is the first generation ring, but this is by far the most responsive company I have ever seen.
They're just they're not just shipping any old thing like some are, they are shipping live working rings, and they are working every day to make them better.
We've had software updates, we've had firmware updates, they have multiple channels for people who've received their rings already to submit issues and they're working on them and fixing them and they're putting serious effort into making this the best smart ring out there. If I had gotten a tenth of this support from that other company, I might still have that ring.
I thought smart rings were a great idea from when I first heard of them, I can't wear the watches comfortably because my wrists are too small, and I'm absolutely thrilled with this product. It is lightweight, and fits well And it does a great job of what it's supposed to. Someone else has posted on here all the things it does, so I'm not going to list them again, and I'll admit all of the readings are not 100% perfect yet, but since I've had mine, I've seen it get better and better and better. I keep thinking I want to get one from another company just to be able to compare them, but so far, there's no one out there that even comes close to being worth bothering with.
If you're thinking of getting a smart ring, this is the one. This ring is actually in production, and being shipped. It is not a pie in the sky fantasy like some of the other ones being sold are and there's no monthly subscription fee, so they're not trying to do a money grab. These rings are being shipped, and they are working.",5,2023-03-29T06:18:56.000Z,Courtney Tell,US,1.0
The company says they are in Delaware…,"The company says they are in Delaware United states they are not.

I ordered in December of 2022, at the time. They said they are in production mode with local delivery in February.

In January the sizing kit arrived, and that apparently fulfilled the pledge. Ring has not yet shipped, and they have said, we meant to say shipping starts after Feb.

Of the 7100 backers from Dec around 900 have received rings.

The rest get to run around the company is actually out of china. They are currently under investigation from Indegogo for violation of crowdfunding rules.

They are extremely aggressive at removing all negative reviews on social media. Anyone says anything negative or complains about the ring. Gets the post deleted as hate speech.

They have now said they will ship another 1500 sometime in the next few weeks (maybe)

They say so many contradicting things its incredible.

So far most people getting black rings.. are showing they are easily scratched.

Sleep data is way off, and seams to be generic. A few users posted screen shots. Showing they had the exact same sleep data.

Issues reported with steps.

They advertise they do body temp, but now say its not actually enabled at this time. And will be at a later date.

But is still listed as a feature.

I would avoid this Chinese company that is pretending to be a US company at all costs.",1,2023-03-25T14:54:45.000Z,Charles Ward,US,3.0
RingConn Smart Ring,"Spotted this ring on indigogo site in Nov 2022 was a bit wary of buying as some company’s do not always deliver
But from purchasing the product they stated deliveries estimated Feb/March 2023 if I remember rightly
They gave lots of updates and within a month I received my sizing ring December 2022 and the Ring in February 6 2023
Wow what a piece of technology well worth the money it does exactly same as the Oura ring but no subscription.
They say 7 day battery life had it on for 7 days and still 19% battery and took 1 hour to recharge to 100% so really impressed , also it has portable charging case good for vacations. I
The company have been very good on answering any questions on messenger
All readings on the app are quite good couple small glitches but there ironing them out,
I have compared it to my Apple Watch and very similar only this does a great deal more
On the ring the sizing kit I picked size 12 and when the ring come size 12 it was actually comfier than the sizing ring.
If anyone thinking of getting a smart ring I highly recommend this one absolutely love it even picks up when I have a nap
These are the charts in the app

"Sizing kit arrived, but ring is MIA and no one cares.","Sizing kit arrived, confirmed my ring, it shipped, and then nothing. For a while, once the ring shipped it was staying in the destination state with no movement. I asked the carrier what was up, so then for some inexplicable reason they put it on a plane to a state 1200 miles from mine. The delivery got delayed. Carrier is no help as none of their reps speak English too well. So, I reached out to Oura stating I would be requesting a refund and, if the ring never arrived, initiating a chargeback. At first, I managed to get past the AI bodyguard and reach a live person. The live person, Joy, said I had to wait 5 days for a package that plainly won't show up since I just have a yellow delivery updated on my package tracking (Fedex is a mistake, guys). She didn't seem to care I am out $500 on this thing. So, I checked with the AI bot last night, couldn't figure out how to slip the bodyguard to get a human, and the AI just said to buy a new one and send this one back when it shows up. I told the dumb robot it is not showing up, hence the issue. Oura won't contact the carrier to reroute my package. I finally got fed up and got a replacement from Target. I'll initiate a chargeback from Oura when they don't refund me for their mistake of using Fedex of all America's carriers to deliver things.I am worried someone stole it. If it truly doesn't show up, I'll have to file a police report but not sure how that will go in another state... in any case, all I want is my money back at this point. Target at least will get me my product AND they have phone numbers you can call to talk to people! What a novel concept, having phone support.

"Great at first then totally unusable, don't waste your money","I bought my Oura 5 years ago.  After 2 years I stared having issues.  I flagged them with customer care,  was told to factory reset etc which I did.  More issues followed in my third year with it,  the battery life was getting really poor.  I flagged this and was told it wasn no longer under warranty.  Their only workaround was to offer me a discount for a newer model that was still expensive even after the discount.  Very disappointing given the price I originally paid.  I couldn't afford another one so have continued to use it until recently, when it's completely stopped functioning.  The battery life was down to needing a charge daily, now it just doesn't work.  Whilst I enjoyed my first couple of years with this and used to recommend them to everyone,  I would suggest you stay well away from them now I know how they are longer term as it's a lot of money for something that breaks that relatively quickly.

Save your money,"I have had an Oura ring for one year, and it has already died and stopped working completely. After some research, I have found that many Oura rings do not work after a little over a year. When confronted with this problem, Oura refuses to send a new ring and only provides a $50 discount to buy a new $500 ring. I had the 3 year warranty, and was still asked to pay for part of a new ring (because I had the gold option) when it should be completely covered. Oura rings are a waste of money and do not work after a year. I would save your money and get a different tracking product for your health, because you will have to buy a new Oura ring every year or so.",1,2025-07-24T19:35:28.000Z,Tara Prendeville,US,1.0

Overpriced and Disappointing Durability,"Overpriced and Disappointing DurabilityWhile the app is well-designed and easy to use, the overall product falls short in a few key areas. The ring material scratches far too easily — mine already has visible scratches after just six months of use. For a high-end wearable that's meant to last several years, this level of fragility is disappointing.Additionally, the data tracking seems inconsistent. Even after a poor night’s sleep, I still receive unusually high readiness scores, which makes me question the accuracy of the metrics.Given the combination of questionable data reliability and subpar material quality, I don’t believe the product justifies its high price. It feels overpriced for what it offers, both in terms of service and build.",2,2025-07-22T13:08:04.000Z,João F,PT,2.0
Rip-off software - Look at alternatives without subscription,"The hardware is good but the software is a rip-off. If you're on the free plan you get three data points. Three! After spending hundreds of pounds they give you the most basic of information. It doesn't even tell you the number of hours sleep you've had. You have to pay for them to surface the data and whilst it is compelling and granular, the cost per month is ridiculous just to press a button as the ring is always collecting the data. For the same amount of money, I get Amazon Prime, which is free next-day delivery and a full TV streaming service. It's not like you get loads of new stuff either for your money. In the 4 months I paid for the subscription zero new features were added. I think they need to be much clearer to customers - our free plan is rubbish, so if you're buying an Oura product, be prepared to pay a subscription for life. I won't be sticking with Oura when my current Oura hardware is looking old and tired. Terrible company trying to squeeze every penny they can from customers.",1,2025-07-22T12:11:25.000Z,Daniel Jennings,GB,4.0

I have had an Oura Ring for…,"I have had an Oura Ring for approximately 4 years now. I initially got it to improve my fitness and to pair with another app to easily record my basal temperature. However, I have been enjoying more than just those features. My ring and the app help me track my sleep, my heart rate, my food, my stress, etc. I've even used it as a sleep aid since there is a meditation feature on the app. Recently, my original ring that I bought was no longer charging and so I contacted customer service. They were incredibly prompt with a response to resolve the issue by sending me a new ring and taking a month off for my membership payment. Mind you, I was past my warranty so I was shocked with the offer to replace the ring with one that had been reset. What's more, the replacement was free! They had offered me a chance to upgrade my ring to their latest version for a discount, but I didn't mind the latter. Within 3 days of reporting the issue, I received my new ring and I'm back at it. I've never experienced such great customer service! Because of that and the features, I will continue to choose Oura over other biometric ring companies.

"Misleading, Dysfunctional, and Will Be Reported","If you’re considering Oura, save yourself the headache. This product does not work as advertised, and customer service is dismissive and unhelpful. If you paid with your FSA/HSA (as I did and many others do), read this before you waste your funds on a “medical” device that fails at basic features.I bought Oura specifically for wellness and meditation tracking. It has repeatedly failed to detect meditation sessions, app crashes are routine, and every attempt to follow their instructions results in the same outcome: NOTHING works as promised. This is a systemic, well-documented problem—search any forum or reviews.Oura’s “support” is nothing more than automated scripts blaming the user. I did everything by the book—phone connected, app running, airplane mode off, app not force-closed—and still the same bugs. When I pushed for accountability, I was met with a patronizing lecture about “professional language,” as if a frustrated, paying customer isn’t allowed to express real anger after being scammed out of their money.For the record: Using profanity out of frustration is not “harassment.” It’s protected speech, and customer service reps are not legally entitled to refuse service simply because a customer is upset—especially after wasting over $3,600 on rings and annual memberships for myself and all 5 of my close family believing their false advertising. No one used hate speech or targeted abuse. I used adult language to express valid anger at a broken product and a dismissive company.I paid using my HSA/FSA because Oura claims to be a “health device.” That means you are accountable to:	•	FTC (Federal Trade Commission) for false advertising and deceptive practices	•	FDA (if your marketing crosses the line into regulated medical device claims)	•	State Attorney General (for consumer fraud—especially with HSA/FSA purchases)	•	Better Business Bureau	•	Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)	•	Insurance plan administrators who approve Oura for HSA/FSA funds	•	Every review and complaint site I can find (Trustpilot, Reddit, BBB, and more)I am reporting this product for failing to deliver advertised functionality, for misleading health claims, and for hostile, unhelpful customer support that places blame on the customer. If enough people do the same, Oura will be forced to answer for these practices—legally and financially.Final Warning to Others:Do not waste your FSA/HSA funds or your hard-earned money on Oura. They will take your money, sell you a broken promise, and hide behind condescending customer service scripts when it fails. There are many better options for wearables that are more affordable. If you’ve been similarly wronged, file complaints with every agency above and do not let them silence you because you dared to use strong language out of justified frustration.",1,2025-07-18T09:56:33.000Z,Sarai De Leon,,3.0

It CROAKS in 18 months,"Oh, I’ve had the ring since September 2022 — a whirlwind romance, really. We even had a little hiccup with the first one: had to exchange it because the battery gave up on life. I thought, eh can  happen. The second one on my finger since Jan '24. After a few months, the battery life dropped to under 5 days. Not great, but I’m easygoing, I rolled with it.Fast forward 18 months to today and now we’re talking full-on battery apocalypse — dead in under 10 hours. Impressive, really. So, I did what any hopeful user would do: spent two delightful hours playing chat roulette with various support agents. Each time I dared to switch to the app for basic info? Poof! Chat gone. Start over. Rinse, repeat.Eventually, the grand reveal: “Your warranty’s expired, but out of the sheer kindness of our algorithmic hearts, we’ll give you a refurbished ring!” Ah yes, the generous corporate benevolence — because, let’s be honest, without a warranty, you normally get diddly-squat. But hey, a second-hand replacement still lets them siphon off juicy health data to sell to Big Pharma while keeping that sweet subscription money flowing.And the cherry on top? Nowhere — nowhere — did it say the ring comes with an expiration date shorter than a carton of oat milk. If you just said upfront, “Hey, this ring’s gonna croak in 18 months,” fine! That would’ve been my choice. But instead, I get to feel like I’ve been tricked by a piece of jewelry with commitment issues.Honestly… shame on you.",1,2025-07-17T11:14:52.000Z,Alex de Mare,NL,3.0

So my night’s sleep has gotten progressively worse over the past week—41 last night all down to the ring. Finally took it off at about 3 a.m. and fell into a deep sleep until 5:40.

Absolutely love my Oura Ring Gen 4 – a game‑changer for health!,"I’ve been wearing the Oura Ring Gen 4 for several months now, and honestly — it’s been life‑changing. Not just a gadget, but a quiet, insightful companion that helps me understand myself better every day.It’s incredibly light and comfortable — I often forget I’m wearing it. Yet the data it gives me is so powerful. I love how it shows me when I’m truly recovering and when I’m under stress, even if I don’t consciously feel it. One of the coolest things I’ve noticed is how playing with my kids actually puts me into a restorative state. I would have never realized how much those moments recharge me without Oura showing me.The sleep insights are amazing — I’ve started making better choices just to protect my sleep and feel more energized. The readiness score is spot‑on: when it tells me to take it easy, I usually already feel that in my body, and when it says I’m ready to push, it gives me confidence to go for it.I also love how discreet it is — no notifications, no distractions, just clear, meaningful feedback when I open the app.There is a membership fee, but for me it’s worth every cent. The awareness it’s given me — about my stress, my sleep, my recovery, even how my body responds to different activities — is invaluable.If you care about your health and want a deeper connection to your body, I couldn’t recommend Oura more highly. Playing with my kids, taking care of myself, even knowing when to slow down — Oura has made me better at all of it.Five stars, no doubt!",5,2025-07-13T17:53:14.000Z,Tomáš Michálek,CZ,2.0

Why Oura Ring is a Good Choice,"I have had my ring for almost a year and I have found it helpful in my journey to be more healthy. Seeing the changes in my heart rate and ability to respond to stress pushes me to see more improvement, while seeing my sleep score, readiness score and symptom radar lets me know when I need to take a day and take it easy so I don’t burn out. And I can use the data to understand what causes stress responses (good and bad), what helps me have a better night sleep, and what level of daily activity leaves me feeling my best.In the last month I noticed that my battery life was decreasing to only lasting 24 hours instead of the 6-7 days I was used to. I reached out to customer service in the app and got an immediate response. Using my email address they could see that there was an issue with the battery. Within minutes they told me a new ring would be on the way. Four days later I had a brand new ring. No hoops to jump through, no questions asked. That level of customer service is so rare to find. I would not hesitate to suggest the Oura ring to anyone who wants a better understanding of what is going on with their body.",5,2025-07-12T16:06:47.000Z,Shawna Smith,US,1.0

no security features for stolen/robbed ring,"I lost my Oura ring and made contact with the help center of theier app. They don't have any security tool for lost or robbed ring. But the worst is yet to come. Even though they have the serial number of the ring, they cannot block the new (unauthorized) user or report who is trying to log your ring. The only thing they asure is that the person will not access your healthy data. Then, at july 3rd they offered me 2 options : a USD 50 discount OR to receive a refurbished ring. I didn´t have the address yet and asked how I should get in contact informing it. They said my previous conversation would be resumed as I asked for help at the app chat. So I did. They didn't find my conversation. I sent the previous request number and they said they didnt find anything. Then I sent the photo of the e-mail I received from then with the request number and finnaly they admited there was a deal to send me the refurbished ring. But everytime I would send the address so they send the refurbished ring, the chat closed and when I opened all the conversation was erased. Many times.

4 replacements since November 2024,"Since my first ring purchase in November 2024 (stealth variant) we have had to have replacements over and over again with my family - my wife and our two daughters also have each a ring (also stealth - although wife’s was replaced with silver) 1. Fell apart into 3 pieces when taking off2. Heavily scratched within days of use (NO GYM OR cooking just from being an office worker)3. Developed battery issues and was notified in the app4. Again heavily scratched and battery nowhere near advertisedI am convinced the quality of their stealth rings just isn’t fit for purpose - I have a CHEAP Tapster ring to open the car and contactless payments (oura take note!) that I’ve owned for 3 years and not a single scratch!!!!Now I will preface this, that up until now, Oura staff have been empathetic and have replaced the faulty rings.Sadly, my most recent experience with a so called technical support manager (Leia) has been vastly different - not only have they made no efforts to offer a replacement of my most recent faulty ring nor would they let me pay more to try more to get a different finish as a last ditch attempt to see if the problems lie with the stealth finish.Slow to respond and uncooperative - very different to Oura’s European support staff! As a Swede, we have been proud to support our Finnish neighbours and loyal to Oura despite the monthly subscription fees and poor quality finishes.Given our last experience we will be looking to migrate the family over to Luna and/or Ultrahuman.",1,2025-06-27T08:18:46.000Z,nima azodi,SE,7.0

OURA - Garbage Data In Garbage Data Out Support No: 4678959,"In response to linkedIn COmment about Oura being great Love seeing these comments and as a four generation user it is interesting to hear the comments. I have been communicating with Tom and others for months. about an inherent problem with OURA 4 calculating data incorrectly making all key metrics are suspect and the data outgoing ultimately flawed. It took me months for OURA to finally admit it is a known problem for many users, and they haven't chosen to focus enough resources to fix the problem, as development resources are focused elsewhere. Either a) developing other features promised to investors in their product roadmap, or b) fixing other problems they deem even more damaging. Both points give me cause for concern. It also makes me wonder how many people congratulating this announcement, either know/don't know of the problem(s), or are maybe investors themselves, and therefore somewhat biased.I eagerly look forward to a fix that has been a documented problem to Tom and others for months. I am sure they will be glad to furnish you with the documentation.A very concerned, honest, six year Oura customer. hashtag#TIME100Companies hashtag#WithOura hashtag#oura Tom Hale Chris Jones JP Underwood",1,2025-07-04T14:49:34.000Z,Michel Mercieca,US,2.0

The data from the ring has been invaluable in helping me understand which strategies have worked and which have not, so I was anxious when my ring suddenly stopped transmitting sleep data.

Oura worked quickly to replace my ring, and I will be receiving it only a few days after my current ring stopped working.

Life changing device- incredible customer service,"I loved my oura ring before even having to contact customer service.I bought my first Oura ring (model 4) this past November 2025. Since then, I have fully integrated it into my daily life. It has taught me more about my body than I have ever known. It has helped track my workouts, my infertility journey and sleep issues. I have recommended it to countless people (I should have made a commissions! lol)This past week (June 2025) I noticed that my battery was being drained much faster than normal. I usually can get 5+ days out of it while still using each feature to the max (recording HR workouts everyday, etc). I opened the app, found “Finn” the AI help, and simply asked him to run a diagnostic on the battery. It immediately came back with the fact that my ring was not running optimal, and a customer service rep would contact me to send me a new ring.I was skeptical, but an hour later, Anne emailed me to get my mailing information and a copy of my purchase receipt (from Best Buy) to send me a new ring.Blown away.

I upgraded to the rose gold version, and the finish has not held up at all. It’s now scratched, tarnished, and has taken on a greenish tint — definitely not what I expected for the price point.As for the insights, they’re underwhelming. Aside from sleep tracking (which is fairly solid), the ring provides minimal meaningful feedback. My Apple Watch does a far better job with activity tracking, heart rate insights, and overall health data. The Oura Ring feels more like a trendy accessory than a true health tool.It’s being promoted as a powerful wellness tracker, but in reality, it doesn’t offer medical-grade insights or the actionable data it claims to.

"Sadly, repeated battery issues – even with replacement ring","I was initially very impressed with the Oura Ring – beautiful design, useful sleep tracking, and a well-made app. But unfortunately, the hardware quality has been disappointing.My first Gen3 ring developed serious battery issues after about a year. To Oura’s credit, they provided a replacement, and I appreciated their support at that time.However, the replacement ring has now started showing the exact same issue, again after about a year of regular use. The battery barely lasts a day, even though I’ve always followed proper charging habits (no overcharging, avoiding deep discharge, etc.).What frustrates me most is that the hardware price is way too high for this level of durability—especially since you also have to pay a monthly subscription fee on top of the expensive ring. For a premium product, I expect a much more reliable and long-lasting device.This doesn’t seem to be an isolated case either; many users report similar problems (see Reddit and other forums).The concept is great, but for this price, and with ongoing subscription costs, I sadly can no longer recommend the Oura Ring.",1,2025-06-18T09:19:08.000Z,MK,DE,1.0

I couldn't afford to replace it and as it was 6 months old I was out of any return window. I also bought it from John Lewis and not Oura directly. However they made an exception and accepted my ring back to exchange for a smaller size. They provided the return postage label too. Oura also gave me 3 months complimentary subscription. Shout out to Lucy, Emily and Matt who provided amazing, compassionate  customer service. The Ring 4 is an amazing product. It's health tracking is so accurate and the battery lasts several days.

A Lifeline in a Tiny Ring,"I’ve been using my Oura Ring since the end of 2019, and I can honestly say it’s been one of the most life-changing tools I’ve ever owned.With a complex mix of chronic health conditions, I used to feel completely in the dark—unsure when it was safe to push myself and when I needed to stop. The Oura Ring changed that. Its temperature tracking, heart rate monitoring, sleep analysis, and stress indicators have become a true lifeline. I now understand what my body needs, when to rest, and when I’m okay to move forward. That kind of clarity has brought a quiet peace I didn’t know I was missing.And the customer service? Absolutely phenomenal. Every time I’ve had an issue with my ring or charger, the team has gone above and beyond.

Inaccurate Data and Customer Support isnt great,"I have had the oura ring since June 2023 and have taken care of it well. I have noticed over the course of time I have had it that it does not pick up my activity metrics very accurately. Down to the time frames of when I worked out being hours off from the actual time I worked out. The length of time, type of workout and heart rate seem vert skewed as well.I compared it to my garmin and the calories distance and even heart rate were significantly off -  I have followed every type of reset and update that are recommended and am still not seeing it get more accurate when compared to an apple watch or garmin. I reached out to support within the year I purchased it and they told me there was no way to receive a replacement, and said I should have been more careful with it. For something this expensive it was shocking to me that they did not offer a replacement or some sort of refund. I really like the sleep metrics and want to be able to track that and my cycle and temperature but dont feel I can trust the ring with all the discrepancies I am seeing. Ideally they would allow for a replacement so I could prove its just a defect?",1,2025-06-16T23:10:14.000Z,Rachel Braun,US,1.0

They didn’t just brush off my concerns. they listened, understood and took action. It’s rare to find a brand that stands behind its product like this.

"Great Before Gen 4, Now, NOT","UPDATE: As soon as I posted here and with the BBB, they have issued a refund for the ring and the charger. It seems the person above who I was dealing with agreed that this was taking too long and got it taken care of immediately.Before the Gen 4 ring, I would have given them a 5 star rating. Fist, my charger stopped working (everything is still under warranty). They sent a new one. My ring stopped connecting, then completely died, with the new charger. I am 27 emails in, back and forth and now all of a sudden, after asking me if I wanted to process the return of the ring and the charger, they need to escalate my issue. It appears to me the escalation is an attempt to push the time frame so my warranty runs out. I NEVER had this issue with my previous Oura Rings or their customer service.

"A 20-Year Journey in Preventive Health, Perfected by Oura","I’ve been a dedicated Oura Ring user for over four years, but my journey into preventive health technology began much earlier. My choice of Oura was deliberate, driven by a long-standing appreciation for comprehensive health metrics that go beyond simply noticing when you’re sick.Some 20 years ago, my business partner and I founded a preventive health care company called World of Wellness. Our mission was guided by the World Health Organization's definition of health: ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."" We developed a personal health maintenance program built on a digital and physical wellness test. To capture the physical data, we relied on an array of specialized equipment: heart rate monitors, VO2 max machines, stress monitors, and body composition analyzers. It was a cumbersome but necessary process to generate a holistic ""Wellness Index"" for our clients.Fast forward to today, and it’s astonishing what the Oura Ring and its app can accomplish. With the exception of blood pressure and a detailed Body-Impedance Analysis (BIA), the Oura Ring seamlessly provides nearly all the vital statistics that once required a room full of equipment. It has effectively consolidated our old, complex testing protocol into a single, elegant device.For anyone serious about proactive health and understanding the complete picture of their well-being, the Oura Ring is a remarkable tool. It represents the very thing we were trying to build two decades ago—a simple, effective way to maintain personal health—but perfected in a way we could only have dreamed of back then.",5,2025-06-13T20:54:53.000Z,Ebel Magnin,CO,1.0

Disappointing Quality and Poor Customer Support,"I had high hopes for the Oura Ring, especially given the $350 price tag.

I was promised a replacement, waited over a week without any updates, and was then told they can’t ship to Zambia—despite the fact that they sold the ring to me in Zambia in the first place.

Wish I could give negative rating.,"There was a previous review that stated how awful the customer service was. Their complaints do not do justice to how awful it is. My Gen 3 worked well. Upgraded to Gen 4 and had issues from day 1. Went through the customer service route at least 5 times. The ring stops tracking sleep for 3-12 days in a row.  Everytime they respond (usually 3-5 days if im lucky) they tell me to do the same steps, make sure ring is charged, check this setting and that setting same crap that never works. Repeated this process until I finally cancelled the service. 2 months later get another customer service email telling me to charge and reset.  But they are offering me a whole 6 months no charge.  For a service I cancelled and doesn't work. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  Get a Samsung or UltraHuman and save yourself a huge headache. Its been almost a month now since my review and they said someone will reach out.  Not a word from anyone. Horrendous.",1,2025-07-07T16:36:10.000Z,Todd Kowalski,US,1.0
Great service,"I purchased my Oura ring on May 15, I learned to love it and keep track of my body. This was especially important to me as I just started a new health journey. The ring was great for the first two weeks but for some reason my battery kept dying ridiculously fast, and it got worse over time and it reached the point of only lasting half the day. So I figured I got a faulty ring. Naturally I would have went to exchange it but I already past the return/exchange period. So I did some googling and saw that Oura does replace the ring as I read in some discussion boards. I reached out to customer service via my Oura app and started with the chat box about my rings battery life, they ran a test and was able to confirm I had a faulty battery. From there the chat box connected me to customer service and they were swift with contacting me and sending a replacement. I’m very happy with the the results of this. Thank you.",5,2025-06-05T18:06:40.000Z,Samira Hamed,US,1.0

Don't Trust AI bot or Count on Live Support,"After I received my new Oura Ring, setting up the apps I used the online bot.  Great it was really fast, no waiting for those ""..."" intervals. Unfortunately, the AI bot was hallucinating or had incorrect sources and in the process my account was locked. So, it submitted a trouble ticket for me.  Several weekdays (no weekend real support available) later I received a rude response that it was not possible to do what I was attempting to do, while refusing to acknowledge that the AI bot had told me to do it.  Also, the online documentation is complexly organized to be diffifult to navigate only if you already know what is there, and definitely not for finding a fix for an hallucinating problem.  After a few exchanges passed (with days more of gaps) with no actual help but a few hints I was apple to get the iOS app to work. On the last day of my free trial my ticket was passed to a support manager.  She was great, she unlocked my account, clearing up a number of issues.  Only after I gave her a good review did they ask me to post a review on Trustpilot, so I suspect this is not what they anticipated.  The ring data, once you can get to it, is interesting but not necessarily insightful.  But it's a great concept. So, just be prepared to deal with arrogant and unreliable support and to escalate quickly, not that they make that easy either.",2,2025-06-05T01:14:03.000Z,Sylvia Shiroyama,US,3.0
Oura stands firmly behind their products.,Recently my ring was struggling to hold battery charge. I reached out to Oura and opened a ticket with them.

Never had to wait long for a response and once the claim was filed the ring was on its way to me.

Sleep, stress, cycles, recovery — it doesn’t lie. And it’s been one of the only things keeping me accountable when motivation slips.Sometimes it just feels good to have proof that your hard work is doing something. That you’re not crazy.

Customer service literally non existent,"I love my ring, however customer service is quite literally non existent! There is a chatbot called Finn that simply over and over again asks for your email address for you to await an email message from someone at some point. If like me, you want and need to speak to a physical person it’s literally impossible! I’ve also found the cost of a replacement charger / locating one in correct size (gen3) nigh on impossible and to have one sent from Oura itself costs a ridiculous amount in postage far more than any other overseas company I’ve ever bought from. In summary, good product, but non existent customer service. Incredibly frustrating. Also, reading through many other reviews lamenting the fact that a product that costs the best part of half a grand has no physical agents to speak to I see Oura respond with “if you ask for live agent you will be connected to one”. Lies! Chatbot Finn will not ever connect you!! I have tried 5 times over asking for a live agent in every manner conceivable and it keeps asking for an email address “in order to connect me”. Lies: once an email address is sent it says “await email response” and abruptly terminates the conversation. I wish it were possible to post the screenshots of these incredibly frustrating chatbot conversations to prove the Oura official responses on here are lies, you will not be connected to a real live agent. Well, I am abruptly terminating my subscription with them since customer service cannot even be called shocking I guess as it flat out doesn’t even exist!",1,2025-05-29T12:56:49.000Z,Emma Paul,GB,3.0

Apple Watch to Oura 4,"I wore an Apple Watch before the ring but wanted something more “ambient” and less “alert focused”. Initially, I was a little worried about accuracy, insights and also whether it would scratch badly. On the metrics side, it seems about right - as in not a million miles away from my Apple Watch which I wore in tandem for a few weeks. I really like the fact it interprets the metrics and turns them into more useful insights… like readiness, symptom radar, and resilience. And I like the richer sleep tracking and more integrated use of HRV. On the scratch side, it’s held up remarkably well… I’ve been relatively careful (e.g. wearing gloves when gardening, “paws” when using weights) but I do forgot now and again, and have accidentally run it along rough surfaces and, so far, any marks have just rubbed off, like it self heals to some degree. So, 9 months in, not a single scratch… which is pretty surprising. I also like the new features that get released, like better activity tracking, better nap detection, symptom radar, AI meal tracking (just take a photo and get a high-level breakdown), and other things. The Support team is also great. I had some battery questions and they helped out, even checking the data they could see about the device to advise me. So, so far, very impressed and I would recommend… especially if you’re into quiet and mindful tech that’s easy to live with.",5,2025-06-07T05:14:51.000Z,I Short,GB,3.0

Expensive mistake – disappointing accuracy and poor value (so far),"I initially rated the Oura Ring 1 star, but I’ve now raised this to 2 stars after Oura customer service offered a 12-month complimentary membership as a goodwill gesture. I appreciate the effort to make things right and may consider updating this rating further if I have a better experience during this period.I really regret buying the Oura Ring. For £300 plus a £5.99/month subscription, I expected reliable and useful health data. Unfortunately, the sleep tracking has been inaccurate on multiple occasions — including nights where I was clearly awake for several hours in bed, yet the ring still reported this time as restful sleep. Worse still, the option is not available to simply manually update the numbers to fix its inaccuracies, which makes the Oura Ring very unreliable.Looking back, I wish I had chosen a different product—something with better accuracy, more flexible functionality, and without the burden of a monthly subscription just to access key features. I raised my concerns with Oura’s customer service and requested a refund, but was told that inaccuracies didn’t fall under their warranty, and that refunds are only available within 30 days of purchase. Given the price, the subscription model, and the health-related use case I explained, I was left very disappointed by the lack of resolution.If you’re considering this ring for health monitoring, I’d recommend looking elsewhere. Other options like the Samsung Ring don’t require a monthly fee and may offer better value. Oura’s high price, limited accuracy, and paywalled features have left me very disappointed — though I now wait to see whether the experience improves over the complimentary year of access.",1,2025-06-02T13:59:26.000Z,Direct_Truth,GB,7.0

Above-and-beyond customer care,"I’ve been an Oura user for years, and their recent handling of a battery issue with my out-of-warranty ring completely won me over. When I contacted support expecting little help, they surprised me by offering a free restored Gen3 replacement—no pushy upsells, just genuine care for a loyal customer.  The process was smooth, and the restored ring works perfectly (looks and feels brand new!). What stood out was how they turned a frustrating situation into a demonstration of integrity. In an era where companies nickel-and-dim customers, Oura’s willingness to stand behind their product—even years later—is rare and refreshing.  Yes, the membership model takes getting used to, but the hardware quality and *this* level of service make it worth it. If you value a company that treats customers like people rather than transactions, Oura delivers.",5,2025-05-14T21:22:45.000Z,Gurleen Dhiman,CA,1.0

The app experience is smooth and intuitive, and the ring itself is comfortable and stylish. I’ve found the health data to be more useful than I originally anticipated.I got the Oura ring to track my cycle and pair with Natural Cycles for contraception after removing my IUD, and it has worked well for this purpose. Additionally, I’ve found the sleep data fascinating, which has motivated me to adjust some habits based on the insights it provides about what impacts my sleep.When the battery life of my first ring declined to about 24 hours, I contacted Oura support.

Best ring on the market at the moment.,"Oura has made me very satisfied recently with the introduction of several new features which helps to set the company apart from other ring brands. I really appreciate how Oura listens to their community and Oura is one of the few brands who is very involved and active in their community. They frequently respond to comments on their social media and are heavily involved in apps such as Reddit. I think this improves brand trust and shows their community that they are listening. Some people including myself are not thrilled about paying a monthly subscription fee, however if Oura continues to regularly update their product with new meaningful features then im okay with the monthly fee. I’ve never had an issue with my rings so I can’t speak to their support, but I know they have addressed some of their shortcomings and it looks like they are trying to make it better.",5,2025-05-13T06:11:49.000Z,Carson Lewis,US,2.0

Poor customer service.,I have had ring 4 for about 2 months now. Initially all worked well but recently missing heart rate data at times and extending acknowledged nap times for hours without asking for confirmation. This cannot be changed. Can only be deleted which would lead to incorrect data. Raised with Oura who promise 24 hours response time. It’s been more than 72 hours with no response. Have updated app and things have worsened. Things I slept between 6pm and midnight and that I was awake after midnight. The opposite of what actually happened. This has led to inaccurate data.

Exceeding expectations,"I've had my Oura ring for about 4 months and thus far it has exceeded expectations. I was already familiar with the ring, as close family members have one, but I still did a ton of research before making the plunge. After all, it is a high investment ($400+subscription) and high commitment (wearing a new piece of 'jewelry' 24x7 moving forward) for something some people say is obvious (um, I don't need a score to tell me I slept poorly last night). But thus far, I've really enjoyed all the stats, and love the look of it. All was good until my ring suddenly stopped working. I spent some time going through all the recommended resets and troubleshooting, to no avail. Finally wrote Oura and to their credit, they diagnosed it and said they would send out a new ring, and it got shipped to me (from the Netherlands!) and I was back tracking in less than 7 days. Hopefully that will be the only hiccup, but so far I'm really loving it.",5,2025-04-28T17:56:12.000Z,JH,US,1.0

Unreliable devices and poor customer service!,"I would like to preface this review by stating that I have been an Oura customer since the earliest days of the company and have purchased Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3 rings at full price through their website. In the beginning, I was quite happy with the sleep tracking and also customer service, however as the company has grown they have obviously veered far from their roots and at this point I can no longer recommend anyone purchase an Oura Ring.tldr; poor customer support, unreliable hardware, and recommendations that are too “friendly” and don’t reflect the actual underlying data.My woes began when my Heritage Stealth Gen 3 ring all of a sudden stopped holding a charge, despite being less than a year old. It would simply die after 24 hours or so. I contacted support and was told they detected an issue with the battery and would send me a replacement. Which they did. An exact replacement - Heritage Stealth Gen 3. However this replacement ring suffered an even worse fate after only 9 months or so, when one day a few weeks ago it simply decided to stop connecting to my phone. I went through all the troubleshooting steps and yet it simply wouldn’t respond. It’s important to note that I have been very careful with all of my rings, never subjected them to any abnormal wear and tear or anything like that at all. So this was definitely some kind of internal hardware defect.This time when I reached out to support, however, I was told that I could either choose to receive a discount code with a value of 50 euros/50 dollars to purchase a new ring or I would again be provided with a replacement ring, only this time it would not be a brand-new ring but a refurbished ring, since this was technically a “replacement of a replacement”. The fact that two Gen 3 rings literally died within a year should make anyone considering purchasing an Oura stop and think twice.Ultimately I opted for the replacement ring, and here is where things get wild: although I was promised, in writing, that I would again receive the exact same model and size ring as a replacement, I received a completely different model! Upon bringing this to the customer service rep’s attention, a new rep began replying all of a sudden and directly lied to me, saying that the warranty terms allow Oura to replace a defective ring with any ring of their choosing, which is obviously not the case - the warranty terms are very clear that the replacement ring will only be the same model and size as the ring being replaced.After going back and forth with this new rep numerous times, I was ultimately told that they were not willing to take back the wrong ring and send me the correct replacement, and I was basically out of luck. So now I'm stuck with a ring that I don't like and will only wear at night in bed.Besides the extremely disappointing way this situation was handled, I would also like to note that I currently wear a Whoop strap and an Apple Watch Ultra 2 together with the ring and have noticed extreme discrepancies between the three, with Oura’s activity tracking (steps and calorie burn) being way, way off from reality and the other two devices. Sleep tracking still seems fairly accurate, although Oura’s approach is much more “lenient” - Whoop will tell me that my sleep sucked and I am not at all recovered and need to relax and take it easy, for example, while Oura will basically show the same data but tell me that I’m fine and I should go do something active if I feel up to it. Combine that with Oura's high price and other competitors' rings providing the same functionality for cheaper and without a subscription, and I simply cannot in good faith recommend anyone purchase an Oura Ring now.",1,2025-04-27T19:22:12.000Z,Alexander Kirsch-Clayton,DE,22.0

Non-Existant Customer Service,"I purchased an Oura ring late February, and after wearing it for two weeks, I decided that it just wasn't for me. My husband has one and loves it. While I found the sleep data to be spot-on, I felt that the daytime activity data was not accurate for me. I work at a desk and don't move much, but probably due to excessive hand gestures, my ring thought I was moving quite a bit. I was therefore getting better activity scores than I should have been, while missing out on reminders to get up and move around. I returned the ring through the online portal two weeks after receiving it. I can confirm that they received it on March 21st, according to the FedEx tracking. It's now four weeks later, and I haven't received a refund. I reached out to their customer service 9 days ago, and they stated that it required a ""specialist"" to review my case. I haven't heard back since, despite sending three more messages asking for updates. Anyone purchasing should know that you can't talk to customer service directly; you need to send a message and wait for a response. Initially, I would have recommended Oura to someone looking to improve their sleep because the sleep data is great. Due to their customer service issues, I honestly do not recommend purchasing this product.",1,2025-04-21T20:18:09.000Z,Amy Van Beek,US,2.0

Yes you have to start with the AI Bott “Finn” but when Finn couldn’t resolve the problem ,he forwarded my issue to customer service.

I sent my ring out Monday afternoon, and received my new smaller sized ring on Friday of the same week!

Would not recommend,"I can only comment on the first generation Ring but it’s uncomfortable to wear due to its thickness and also the little nubbins underneath. In fact, I had to stop wearing as it peeled the skin from my finger, leaving what looked and felt like a burn mark. It also never stays in the same position - like all rings, it turns throughout the day. As the Ring needs to be in the correct position (nubbins down), it’s annoying constantly having to adjust.",2,2025-04-19T09:24:19.000Z,Mr David Shepherd,GB,15.0

Efficient to a T,I was a little upset when my new ring of 2 months stopped syncing with my phone. Not deterred I contacted Ouras AI expert. After exhausting all avenues to reset my ring it was passed to the team. OMG I didn't expect what I got. Not only did I get an almost instant email but was nicely worded. Asking for certain information. Not having exactly all that they wanted I did my best and went to bed. Next morning laughing to my wife I said wonder if there is a reply.  To my amazement there was. They had confirmed there was a problem with the ring. Where sending me a new one. Extending the warranty and not to worry about returning the old ring. This being the day before Easter I was amazed. Great product great customer care and brilliant service. Australia would have taken a week to fix the problem. Well done 👏 ✔️,5,2025-04-18T12:47:37.000Z,Graham,AU,1.0
Shocking customer service.,"After 3 months of functioning fine my Oura stopped giving Blood Oxygen and Breathing Regularity data, while still reporting on all other measures. It is very difficult to get a decent Customer Service response - no phone number, first couple of interactions with a ChatBot with the usual ""was it fully charged"", ""have you tried switching it off and on again"" for days before escalated to an online exchange with a person. Have been through several hoops with their suggestions, the last of which, 10 days ago, was to undertake 2 100%-25% charge cycles making regular manual back-ups. Having suggested this they proposed closing the ticket!!! As the problem had not been resolved I insisted the ticket remain open. Advice followed, still no data, notified them of this 3 days ago and not heard a thing from them. Shocking. The ring was expensive, only 3 months old, bought from John Lewis, paying full subscription and have had 3 weeks of missing data and no real customer service to speak of.",1,2025-04-18T12:36:13.000Z,Lorna,GB,2.0

As a very long time oura customer,"As a very long time oura customer. I’ve owned an Oura ring since the very first gen 1 (which was so chunky, and big; but it seemed magical all the same), all the way through a decades worth of Oura’s generations, and now onto Gen 4.This was a request for review of a recent customer service experience. Therefore, this review doesn’t cover my experiences with the Oura ring. Below is from my response to them when they requested feedback, and then requested I post it here as well. I suppose I’m happy to, because I’ve been so passionate about this brand, and its products, yet there’s been an extremely noticeable change in regards to customer service, and support. I absolutely love to recognize standout experiences from individual employees when they provide the level of support that was Oura’s standard, until the last one, to two years. Below is my requested feedback. Then I was asked to post on here. I just wanted to provide context…I have to make this extremely clear. The main reason I decided to fill out this survey is because I’m am so confused as to what happened to the exceptional, outstanding, noteworthy, talented, knowledgeable, kind, patient, understanding, and prompt solution based customer service I knew Oura to be; that is up until about 1, or 2 years ago. My experience with Declan yesterday was good. He’s one of the good ones I hope Oura takes care of, because us customers need more representatives that have been with the company for many years, and still adheres to the Oura brand’s bar it always set so high(until as of late). There’s a few representatives I’ve worked with that remind me there’s still some great representatives with Oura. As far as I can gather now; they are the ones who have been with Oura for several years, and still hold the standard that Oura set! Exceptional! Genuinely, they had completed the entire package that is Oura, by providing extremely detailed, prompt, well communicated care for any, and every concern. I think that my purchase of the gen 4 is the very first time I properly realized what a problem the customer support service is now, because for the first time, I realized I’m making an investment purchase(which I’ve never hesitated on as I can’t imagine not having one after 10 years of daily wear. I paused on this purchase because I now know that should anything concerning come up, or if I had a question; I used to feel so secure knowing no matter what, help was only a quick message away, and the help, resolution, or guidance would come promptly back to me. Now, it’s entirely luck of the draw. Before recently, I’ve only had outstanding customer service experiences with Oura. If I were a new customer however; I’d probably have discontinued supporting Oura due to the new customer services extremely delayed, disorganized, disappointing, disrespectful, and downright incompetent service. I know that may sound like a rough statement to conclude, and share, but i genuinely just hope new customers aren’t being treated with this care. I’ve recommended it to more people than I could ever count, and when several of them have asked me what to do about dealing with the extreme challenges of the recent changes in their customer support, I feel awful. Half the time it’s an exact replica general response, which essentially dismiss the customer, as they don’t address anything directly, or provide assistance with the actual concerns stated by them, and provide no solution, or provide any kind of help. I have no idea what changed in the last 2 years, but something has absolutely changed with the customer support representatives. I’m not sure if Oura has grown exponentially, and to the degree where you now have to outsource your customer support services, and they’re trained differently? I hBut whatever Oura is currently doing is NOT working. I had anxiety over purchasing the new gen 4 , which sounds ridiculous; but I learned that you can no longer depend on Oura’s customer support anymore! So I felt afraid because I know I’m on my own if anything goes wrong. However, because I was matched with Declan this time; it eased my concerns. I was lucky. And it’s also of note that I’ve been with Oura for a decade so I know… I know the change. I know what you’re capable of, and I know the bar has dropped severely as far as customer support! Severely!!! Lucky for Oura I’m a long time original customer, so i know what to do(ignore the incompetent representatives who I feel either lack reading comprehension, or simply could NOT care less that they are losing customers for Oura. And I just wait until i get ahold of a long time representative who remembers the way Oura was before whatever happened over the last 2 years. Please!!!! Pleaseee!!!! Clean house!

Terrible data accuracy matched by their customer service,The worst customer service ever.  The difference between step count and distance covered is gigantic and well outside of a reasonable margin of error. For example yesterday the data showed that I covered 18k of distance but only took 13k steps. I reported this to oura support and they simply brushed it off as a minor accuracy error due to a new clearly broken algorithm. Highly considering abandoning the service in favour of other more accurate brands.,1,2025-04-13T09:56:59.000Z,Geenie,GB,2.0

My battery kept draining faster and faster and I decided to reach out to customer service to see what could be done. Within 1 minute I was given a link so they could run a diagnostic test. The outcome of the test showed a battery issue and there was an immediate solution presented, which was to send me a brand new ring completely free of charge. Then not even an hour later, a representative named Emma collected all my demographic information for where to send my new ring, and to get the color, size, and model. Then within  no time at all I received a confirmation order that my new ring has been ordered and soon will be on its way- completely free of charge. The entire process start to finish was 1-2 hours and they even said to keep my ring and give it to someone else! I am blown away by the customer service. I love my Oura ring so much- it has improved the quality of my life in every way. And now knowing how easy the customer service team is to work with, I’m officially an Oura customer for life.

Oura - excellent product and excellent customer support,"I have been using the Oura ring since 2021. I’ve started with gen 2 and upgraded whenever a new version of the ring was available. During this time I run twice into issues with my rings. Both times customer support was EXCELLENT: focused, mannered and most of all willing to help with everything they could. Even their virtual assistant is great and defers fast to a human if they cannot help further. Also, at one point I wrote a feedback to the company “complaining” that they don’t take into account or manage pregnant women (a situation I was just experiencing). Not only did they reply in few hours but they sent me tons of material on how to benefit from the info the ring provides even if they do not have specifics for pregnant women. Also few months later they started introducing features that take into account pregnancy. I don’t know if my feedback had anything to do with it but I’ve felt heard and I felt important 😅. I will always recommend Oura to anyone that wants a very good product supported by awesome people.",5,2025-04-11T14:36:47.000Z,Alexandra Zdrafcu,RO,1.0

Lifesaver in a Ring – Oura Gen 4 Caught My Chest Infection Early!,"I can’t say enough good things about the Oura Ring Gen 4. One of the most impressive features for me has been the Symptom Radar. It flagged signs of strain on my body before I even realized something was wrong—turns out I had a chest infection! Thanks to the early warning, I was able to get checked out and start treatment before things got worse.The ring itself is sleek and super comfortable to wear all day and night. It gives me detailed insights on my sleep, recovery, and readiness, and now I truly listen to what my body needs. The app is really intuitive, and the health data feels incredibly personalized and accurate.If you’re looking for a smart health tracker that goes beyond the basics, Oura Gen 4 is the one. I genuinely feel more in tune with my health, and in this case, it may have even helped me catch a serious issue early. Highly recommended!",5,2025-04-10T22:14:00.000Z,Mahi,GB,2.0

Great Customer Service and the Product in general,"Oura Customer Service is very empathetic, to the point, understanding and overall very nice to deal with.Oura's policy when it comes to the replacement of a faulty ring is also very generous. I had 2 rings, one mine and one of my mother's. Both of them started experiencing batter issues roughly after 3 years, reducing their battery time to less than 1 day (from around 6-7 initially) which was not ideal considering the purpose of these rings.Despite being a couple of months over the warranty period, in both cases, Ouras Support confirmed the issue with a faulty battery and proposed either a discount on the next purchase OR a free restored replacement ring.In both cases, we got replacement ring,s which are working fine and continue to hold the battery charge for around 5-6 days. Overall, definitely a great experience and the product is also very nice, helping keep track of overall wellbeing, sleep patterns, records activities and exercises and gives a nice overview of body vitals with indication towards restoration or stress periods.I strongly recommend this product and the company and will likely buy the next Gen Oura rings once our current replacement rings stop working.

The algorithm often knows I’m coming down with something before I do. It has helped me learn my own patterns and in some cases, become more in tune with my body. When I recently had an issue with my battery, the AI ran a quick diagnostic and initiated a replacement, Quick and painless. I’ll admit I was a little annoyed when I asked to change the color for my replacement ring to gold and they said no because it was higher value by $50. I wanted to just pay the difference for my replacement ring to be a different color but that wasn’t an option. That seems silly because I was willing to pay the difference but, all in all, I’m happy with my ring and the customer service.",5,2025-04-09T05:56:03.000Z,Meghan Beaudry,US,1.0

After getting an upgraded iPhone, the ring would not connect at all.  I finally put in a ticket to Oura about the Bluetooth connection issue and within 24 hours, they'd replied that they'd noticed an issue with my ring and immediately offered to replace it.  The rep was very helpful and I had several back and forths about the performance of the ring.  The rep issued me a future 2 month credit on my subscription.  Through it all, the customer service was quick, courteous and completely customer-centric.  I appreciate that.  They sent me a replacement in short order and asked me to return the old one so they could study it. I appreciate that this company wants to learn about any issues with their product rather than just solving the immediate issue.  This new ring works so much better.

DO NOT BUY FROM OURA (Order # SO-43454257 ),"I made an order (Order #: SO-43454257) and three days after getting it decided that I did not like it. So as per policy I returned the ring and have been waiting for a refund since the 10th of march. Nothing. My HSA card can see when a refund is being pushed back and it hasn't been initiated yet. It has been 18 days now. This is theft of my money. The chat box is very unhelpful, I never get responses to contact requests and at this point I am very angry. I want my over $400 back and I am done with a stupid chat box who lied directly to me telling me it was a real person because I was angry. Try getting some customer service from real people and give my back my hard earned money. This has been a headache. I need that money back, this company has been nothing but awful to work with. Above was the original review and this was their original response: ""Hi, Hannah.I'm truly sorry for the frustration and inconvenience you've experienced with your refund. I completely understand how upsetting this situation is, especially given the amount of time you've been waiting and the difficulty in getting answers.I was to assure you that you are being heard and I am here to help. I have escalated your ticket to our internal specialists and have highlighted it to our senior agents to ensure it gets the attention it deserves. Rest assured your case is being actively worked on, and our specialist team will be in touch with you via email shortly to update you.We truly appreciate your patience and understanding. I'll do everything I can to make sure this is taken care of as quickly as possible. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. - Rebecca, Oura Social Support Team.""It has now been 3 days since that and 21 days since they received the ring back. Not a word. Not a single email. NOTHING. I am obviously not being heard and I obviously have not been ""escalated"". You have stolen $417.94 from me and I will be getting it back one way or the other. I have been forced to put in a dispute with my HSA card and have the proof from the tracking page with the shipping details showing it arrived to them on the 10th AND I have screenshots of this and their return policies. This has been one joke after another. As of 4/3/2025 it has been a week since I was told I would get a response, STILL NOTHING. I even tried through the AI chat bot AGAIN. NOOOOOTHING. This is fraud, I have returned the ring per the company policies and they are keeping my money and not helping me as they say they will. I am waiting for the dispute to come through at this point.

A Great Tool and Wealth of Information & Support,"I purchased my Oura Ring 4 in Feb 2025 from Best Buy. I have to say that, although I read about the Oura Ring and had an idea how it worked, I was not prepared for the wealth of information it provided. I use a couple apps like Apple Health, Cronometer, and HeadsUp - all which integrate easily with my Oura Ring. So, I have a fantastic, comprehensive view of my health at a glance.  Unfortunately, I started having problems with my ring in early March - it just stopped connecting with my phone app. Although I’m reluctant to use any “chat” help (mostly because it’s almost always a bot that can’t “do” anything), I gave it a shot. Was pleasantly surprised!The automated “helper” kicked off a quick diagnostic test and identified a problem with the battery on my Oura Ring. I was prompted for some information about my Oura Ring which was super easy to find in the app and a ticket was opened for me. I thought it would be a day or two before I heard anything but… nope. I was surprised again.Oura responded in about an hour and asked me to confirm some information. Then they said since my Oura Ring was under warranty, it would be replaced at no cost. I got the replacement ring in a few days and - thanks to the super easy step-by-step instructions in the app - I had the new ring set up in 3-4 minutes and picked up right where I left off. I did not lose any of my previous data because the information was backed up in the process of deactivating the old ring and activating the new ring.While I’ve experienced a great many product and support disappointments when it comes to health information tools, apps, and customer support, my experience with the Oura Ring 4, Oura (as a company), and Oura’s customer support have been A-mazing.",5,2025-03-28T01:29:20.000Z,Mark Templeton,US,1.0

Excellent Customer Service,"I recently purchased the Oura Ring 4, but upon receipt, I found that there was an issue with the battery and the ring wouldn’t hold charge for more than a day. Using the Oura app, I chatted with their AI assistant who performed a diagnostic check of my battery and determined that it was faulty. It immediately created a ticket and passed me over to customer support, who contacted me within the next hour. Customer support was fantastic to work with, and after confirming my shipping information, they told me that a new replacement ring would be shipped as soon as possible. That was midday yesterday and the new ring is scheduled to deliver in two days.  It was the best customer service experience that I’ve had in quite some time.

Ring 4 is pretty bad,"TLDR the oura ring 4 is pretty bad, worse than the previous Gen 3.it's really expensive, way more than 3 and still has a membership on top.The Gen 3 has a premium feel with rounded edges. Gen 4 feels like cheap plastic with annoying sharp corners on the edges.it's really bad data for like a workout and decent for overall health over a longer period of time. the data is nice to have but it's nothing unique and is wrong occasionally. it should be a third the price though. The ring still doesn't offer half sizes which I really need, so only 1 size kinda fits on 1 finger. I can immediately tell it's the wrong size and it falls off frequently but unfortunately it's the only size I can use since ridiculously there are no half sizes.",1,2025-03-21T12:50:44.000Z,SKim,US,6.0

Horrible Customer Service for Oeder,"UPDATE-MY RESPONSE TO OURA:I need this resolved today. For days, there has been no action. No one seems to be doing anything and making it seem like I'm the problem, insinuating that my email address was wrong or I put the order under another email which is not correct. The problem is with your website. It's not my fault your website has issues. You have charged my FSA card for the ring and 1 year membership. And you have charged me bank card for an extended warranty for a ring thats not in process to be shipped. Create an order and make sure my membership starts the day you process the order (not on 3/9/24 because of your website errors). If have given you all the information you requested and nothing. Fix this…OR refund my FSA account for the oura ring 4 and 1 year membership and refund my bank card for the extended warrant immediately. This is insanity for a global brand. If I could go be customer service zero stars I would. Ordered the 4 on the website. FSA account charged for the ring and my bank card was charged TWICE for the extended warranty. No order confirmation. No response via multiple emails even though they claim a 24 hr response time. Asked for help on X, to whici they repliwd to DM them the incident number. But you can't send a direct message to them on X unless you upgrade to a premium account. And I'm not doing that! This is insanity! At this point I just want ALL my money refunded back to both forms of payment immediately. This is a scam!",1,2025-03-12T18:00:13.000Z,TN,US,1.0

Scam vibes with difficult refunds and slow customer service. Do not expect ANY customer service despite paying AUD $644 for a ring and $100+ yearly fees,"A day after I received my Oura ring, I decided that I would like to get a refund. I thought it would be a simple process right? Nup, the company webpage recommends that you talk to customer service if you are from Australia. When you do this, the chat box Finn tells you to look at the webpage for more information. Infinite loop, with Finn repeatedly telling you to go through the order section to request a refund (note: it doesn’t even exist for Australian customers) Then, I finally reach a human. Human takes more than 24 hours to reply to even the simplest questions. Literally been waiting back and forth for DAYS trying to get this sorted. Then to mess it all up, all I asked was a simple inquiry regarding the approx cost of shipping back from Australia. Alexis informed me that they can refund the shipping cost. So I proceeded with the refund and they booked me in for DHL express to collect it from my house. Then they send me an email that the shipping is not refundable. Note I explicitly asked about the shipping cost, and explicitly asked that I only wanted to proceed after knowing the cost. Now I am stuck potentially having to pay $136 aud to ship it back to the Netherlands on top of the non-refundable fees. Thats extremely messed up especially since I EMAILED TO ASK. Also, if I had known, I would not have agreed- and would have asked whether I can use my own postage service etc or atleast thought about it more.

Gen 4,"Bought the gold gen 4 ring. Was very impressed by how smoothly everything went and how quick shipping was. Tried the sizing kit, I really like that they sending you one in advance to try out! But went with the advice to size down when inbetween sizes, because the material will be some smoother than that of the sizing kit. Regret that decision now, it’s too tight. I feel like there could be more information about what is too tight. So I’m going to return it for a size bigger. I’m from the Netherlands, so return needs to happen via customer service. Left a ticket to do so yesterday, so will update on how that goes. But for now really happy and when exploring the app, I really felt like it is going to give a lot of insight!

The extended warranties are handled by a third-party vendor that works with Oura Rings. On 12-28-2024, I received a welcomed email from Extend, but it was only showing one warranty. I got in contact with Extend and they informed me they were missing the invoice for the second ring, and I need to notify Oura Rings and have them email the invoice to  Extend's Warranty Ops dept. I notified Oura Rings on 12-29-2024 about the missing warranty and told them all they needed to do was send a copy of my invoice to rectify the situation. I have been in constant contact with Oura Rings and this situation is still outstanding.  It’s been 4 weeks, and I do not understand why it is taking them so long to get this situation resolved. I worked for Citicorp in their quality assurance department. I consistently had to deal with emailing reports, invoices, and requests. I know it is not a difficult process to attach an invoice to an email and forward it. I am very disappointed with Oura Ring customer service response to my situation.

Very bad costumer service,"Very bad costumer service.  My ring stopped working, didn't connect to my app and did not charge any longer. So I tried reaching out to costumer service. Virtual assistent told me to try the steps on the help page. Which made it worse, because now it’s not even connected in the app. Tried again via the virtual assistant, got the same response. So I tried reaching out again. Gave it a couple of days, because they state it’s busy (because of all the inquiries about the oura4, after reading the bad reviews about costumer service..I think it’s not about that at all). Got a response; we see your ring connects to us, so it’s working. Then I tried to DM via Instagram, got a response for a number. Replied, never heard back. Even when I started to get frustrated and begged for a living human being instead of that shit assistant on the website to contact me, no response. Finally someone reached out, checking with me to see if my charger was broken. It was not. Asked me again for some information, I replied and haven’t heard back in a week. So now I try to start a warranty procedure because I’m stuck with a broken ring, costing me €500 and a membership for over €70 euro’s, all worthless and not functioning. And I get stuck in a costumer service loop of hell. When I try to start the warranty procedure, I receive a standardised mail from Finn to reach out and contact costumer service to start the procedure. The only way to reach out to this company is via the same assistant. So you start another chat stating you want to the start the warranty procedure, which generates an automatic email from Finn to reach out and contact a costumer service member. Which you cannot because the only way to get into contact is via that virtual assistant. Even when you click the links in the “help” articles you get nowhere, but referred back to Finn.

Order no. SO-10583404 and SO-10518988,"I placed orders SO-10583404 and SO-10518988 for over 600 dollars with Oura back in October 2021 and have been dealing with unresolved issues ever since. Despite numerous attempts to find a solution—whether by requesting a refund or asking for the products to be delivered to any of the address of the official residence outside Russia—the company has consistently failed to fulfill its own terms and conditions.Oura repeatedly cites sanctions as the reason they cannot deliver or process a refund, even though I have not lived in a sanctioned country for years. I currently reside in Spain, hold legal EU residency, and have provided multiple alternative shipping and banking options in Georgia, Italy, Germany, and England. Despite this, Oura has always found reasons to avoid resolving the issue, which ultimately points to a lack of competence rather than genuine external limitations.Over the course of nearly four years, not only has no information been updated or changed, but Oura has failed to offer anything at all to improve the customer experience—not even a lifetime subscription or any form of compensation. This is especially disappointing, given that I am a returning customer who trusted the company enough to place a second order.Instead of working with me to find a reasonable resolution, their only response is to keep my ticket open indefinitely with vague promises that “the situation may change.” Meanwhile, I remain without either the product or a refund.I understand the difficulties posed by geopolitical issues, but Oura’s complete refusal to accommodate a long-standing, loyal customer despite clear legal residency in the EU and several viable solutions is unacceptable. This is not just a matter of unfortunate circumstances—it’s a reflection of poor customer service and a lack of accountability.If you are considering purchasing from Oura, be aware that their ability to deliver products or resolve issues appears entirely unreliable. You might end up, like me, waiting for years with no resolution in sight.",1,2025-01-15T06:30:07.000Z,Liliya,IT,2.0

Terrible Service continues,I ordered a ring as a gift prior to Christmas and was sent the wrong size. Following numerous @mails I am still waiting for the correct ring to be sent.They will not send the correct ring until the other one has been returned despite them causing the problem.I have been left waiting for them to arrange collection of the item for over a week and still no news.Terrible customer service and a very poor effort on their part. I have suggested that they send the correct size ring which I ordered while they sort their mess out but they will not entertain that approach so no further forwardUPDATE I am still no further forward with this issue which has now been dragging on for over three weeks. Every time I send an email I get a response a couple of days later from a different person. You say that you have created a new order to send me the correct ring that I paid over £500 for. That is all well and good but why have you not dispatched the order and had it delivered. The customer service continues to be absolutely terrible,1,2025-01-19T14:23:48.000Z,Dorset Company,GB,2.0
The app is a mess - needs substantial work,"I've had this ring over 5 weeks now. The app is a mess. The ring takes ages to detect that I have engaged in activity. Sometimes, it takes 18-24 hours to indicate that an activity has taken place. 4/5 times, it suggests the wrong activity e.g. walking instead of cycling. Furthermore, I have stopped adding my meals. No feedback or response to any food records which I provide. What's the point? Absolutely no point. So I don't bother any more.At the end of each day - once I have uploaded my activity - I can see where I WAS stressed. What use is that??? Why not tell me WHEN I'm stressed so that I CAN DO SOMETHING about it. It's like telling someone after they have crashed their car that the car's airbags were activated 6 hours ago. What good is that?? Why not create an alert on user's phone and provide some in-the-moment solution? The Oura is a very expensive example of Cr*pGPT (Cr*p Guinea Pig Technology). Users provide all their data to help a company leverage it for product development - all for very little practical value-in-return, as far as I can see.Don't get me started on the monthly subscription...

Pretty bad experience with refunds,"I have ordered a ring on December 10th, received it, size not good enough, opened a support inquiry ticket, asked for a refund, sent it back, got confirmation form DHL it was delivered at Oura's facilities from The Netherlands on December 19th. Now, I am not unreasonable, I get that before Christmas it's usually a busy time for all companies, however it's been almost 3 weeks (I know the website /FAQs say 14 business days) but I haven't even received the email that's supposed to notify my the actual refund process had begun. 2 days ago I opened a second ticket asking what is going on, zero reply, only the useless AI chat conversation. From a company this size, which is advertising itself like OURA does, I would have never expected 3 weeks and no refund. At this point I am running out of options to get in contact with them.

"Terrible Service, Do not Order Directly from Oura","On November 30, 2024, I ordered a Oura Ring 4 Black size 12. On December 1, 2024, I was notified that my package was being shipped. I then received a notification on December 16, 2024, that my package had been delivered. That evening, I retrieved the package from my mailbox only to open the sealed box to find that there was not an Oura ring in the package. I contacted Oura Ring customer service on December 18, 2024, at 8:59 am EST to notify them of my issue. I received an automated notification via email that the member care team was looking into it and that they would respond within 24 hours. However, it has now been 4 weeks and despite the numerous emails I have sent them, I have yet to hear back from the member care team, and I am left without a resolution. And there is no customer service phone number that I can contactI am deeply upset and find this situation completely unacceptable. The missing Oura Ring, which was a significant investment ($347.95), was intended as a special Christmas gift. The fact that it has not arrived as promised has not only tarnished my impression of the Oura Ring company but also left me in a difficult position. I am now working with the Maryland State Consumer Protection division to seek legal assistance with this matter. I am also telling all of my fellow gym members, family, and friends to not purchase from this company. By far the worst customer experience I have ever received from a company.

Theft of money and terrible customer support.,"I have a terrible customer experience with that company. I bought Oura Ring (Gen 3) almost 4 years ago and still haven't received it or got my money back. First of all, I bought it in 2021 through official website. It was still possible to do it from Russia. I completed my order and paid for it. I was surprised when I received the letter which says that Oura doesn't have the approval to import hardware components to Russia. For me it was very strange because they were selling to Russia online through their official website. But ok.After almost one year of silence from their side I wrote them again and proposed two solutions: 1. They can ship it to Thailand (where I lived at that time). 2. They can ship it to Canada (where my close relatives live). But they denied both solutions and told me that they can't deliver it to another country. I asked them maybe they can cancel my order, give me some coupon/voucher and I can order it again from different country. They rejected my offer again because of their company policy. So, in total: I bought my ring almost 4 years ago and still don't have my product or my money. Oura company doesn't want to find some solutions their just stole my money and doesn't want to solve the problem. Update - 24.03.2025. Almost, three months left since I post the review here and still no reaction. Worst service ever.",1,2025-03-24T12:08:10.000Z,Anton S.,KZ,9.0
Completely unreliable at tracking steps,"As a longtime (but jaded) user of a Fitbit, I did my due diligence with the newly released to the UK, Oura Ring and decided after reading numerous reviews to fork out the not inconsiderable sum of £400 for a new Gen 4 ring in brushed silver.Big mistake!Whilst the Oura ably tracks my sleep, heartrate and stress levels, it is absolutely terrible at tracking steps.Now I wouldn't mind if if there was was a 5-10% discrepancy in comparison to my Fitbit but it is more like 50%. Now the thing is, I know the Fitbit accurate because I can walk and watch the steps register on my Fitbit so I have pretty much complete confidence in it but you can't do that with the Oura so I wore both the ring and my faithful Fitbit tracker together for a week. Every single day the Oura was registering absurdly fewer steps than I know I had actually done. In comparison with the Fitbit those figures were on average 50% less. Where I could normally hit 10,000 pretty easily with my Fitbit, I'm lucky somedays to hit 5000 on the Oura despite regular dog walks of several miles.My advice to anybody who wants to track steps with the Oura is to give it a wide berth. Its not accurate or reliable at all and I am seriously considering returning mine and buying a much cheaper Fitbit with no monthly subscription fee.",2,2025-01-07T18:22:35.000Z,Neil B,GB,2.0

I purchased the Oura3 6 months ago and…,"I purchased the Oura3 6 months ago and wear 24/7.   The health metrics on the ring are outstanding.   Sleep, HRV, Readiness, Activity,  etc….    Has helped my sleep and recovery both of which are invaluable to my health care.    The negative, and a big negative, is the comfort of the ring.   I have owned for 6 months and constantly rotate between 4 fingers during the day, I move at times when the level of discomfort is high.   I did reach out to Oura and they made numerous  recommendations all of which I had tried prior to reaching out - FYI contact with Oura is only via emails, no call in available.    Somewhat disappointed that the final comment from Oura: “If the ring fits well in all other aspects but still causes discomfort, we completely understand if you decide to take a break from wearing it or even stop using it altogether. Your comfort is paramount, and while the ring provides valuable health insights, it should not come at the cost of your comfort”I would suggest exploring the Oura 4 which was recently released and indicates a slimmer version.    Also, explore other brands which indicate a more comfortable fit.   Buyer beware, if it is not comfortable return immediately to Oura.",2,2025-01-05T00:16:46.000Z,JLCar,US,1.0

Useful but flawed,"I bought my Oura to help me with my sleep, and it does a lot of things that either the Fitbit or the Apple Watch can do, such as tracking naps effectively. For this reason, I will probably keep it. However, I have a couple of concerns. One is that a subscription is necessary on top of the high cost of the ring. As far as I can tell, if I can’t afford the subscription anymore, my ring will become useless despite having shelled at £400 for it. My second concern is related and is that support is not very effective. I am paying a subscription to use this service and I would like it to be effectively supported. There is only email support, though, and a 24 hour lag at least before you get a reply. And as with every customer service outfit everywhere, they start out with a guess at what you might have asked, so you have to get back to them and the whole thing ends up taking a week. Eventually they decided my ring had a hardware issue and the whole thing needs to be replaced. This did nothing at all to change anything. Finally, weirdly there is one sleep tracking aspect that Fitbit wins on, and that is that the Oura does not show detail of how you were sleeping at different times during the night. So if you wondered what time you went to the loo, you can find that out on Fitbit, but not on this. Update: two months on and I'm still waiting for them to help me find one feature that should be in the app and is not there. That's ok, I can cope. But what does bother me a bit is that they are quite happy to spin the conversation on and on, literally forever, despite their having nothing to add or offer. They will not admit that it just doesn't work. They just ask me for more and more screenshots, tell me they are working hard to help, then every few days tell me the case is closed and was everything ok for me?

This is concerning, especially given that I have already been charged a lot of money for the ring. I reached out to customer service twice about this, but I’ve had no response. I’ve not even had a confirmation of shipment. This lack of communication and support has left me feeling uneasy, especially after making a significant payment.

Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money, no product support. I received a version 4 ring for Christmas. When registering you must complete the billing information for the monthly service. The Oura ring address fields will not recognize Washington as a city of DC. I attempted numerous configurations, no dice. Used the on-line chat, it would not recognize my problem, just opened a ticket. Received a response, in a timely manner, requesting I try everything I already stated I had tried and did not work - clearly they had not throughly read the chat. Responded to that email indicating as much. Received a response to my email next day with exact same instructions provided earlier in the same email chain, which I already said I tried and does not work. Again searched for CS phone number, again no dice. Again interacted with the online chat function only to have the exact same thing done, open a ticket recieved the exact same worthless instructions. In this day and age, even the smallest of companies will provide direct customer service. The facts appear to be that OURA has decided to not invest in product support.

Almost there.,"I’ll start by saying I love my Oura ring gen 3. The sleep tracking is phenomenal and the convenience of wearing it instead of my Apple Watch to bed can’t be understated. That being said I have a few gripes with the product that are hard to look past. I understand that it’s a luxary item and the company is trying to expend so the added monthly subscription makes sense in that regard but it still sucks when there is starting to become more competitors in the space particularly Samsung who doesn’t charge a monthly fee. My second complaint was that the ring required specific charging wattage and it didn’t come with a charger that could safely charge the ring, a minor complaint and to be expected of all tech now a days but after just one year of use the included charger stopped working and I had to buy one online and at 60ish $ that’s insane. It’s proprietary too so no looking for an offhand one.

A delivery service that is the worst I have ever known,Bought an Oura ring 4 with a £15 delivery charge.

Disappointing Experience with Oura Ring and Lack of Support,"I purchased the Oura ring recently, but unfortunately, I did not have a positive experience with it. I tried wearing it for less than an hour, but I felt discomfort from both the heat and what I perceived as radiation. Instead of helping with my anxiety, it actually made it worse.The website mentions a 30-day return policy, so I immediately submitted a support ticket (Ticket ID: 4281036) to initiate the return process. However, I have not received a response yet, and I couldn't find any clear instructions on how to return the ring. I also saw that Oura mentioned they are experiencing high ticket volume, which may delay responses.It would be extremely helpful if return instructions were provided directly on the website instead of making customers wait for a response from an agent.Please contact me with the return instructions and return label.",1,2024-12-11T21:00:27.000Z,Netta,IT,3.0

Great experience with Oura Ring and their custome support,"I’m very happy with the product. It looks sleek and stylish, and the data it provides is very useful for helping me adjust my habits. The insights into my sleep patterns and activity levels are particularly useful.Compared to other fitness/well-being trackers, the Oura ring has the additional benefit of being the least intrusive. Being a ring, it is comfortable to be worn all day and all night.I’ve read quite a few negative reviews, especially regarding Oura's Customer Support, but my personal experience with the Oura Ring and their Customer Support has been excellent. I own the Oura Ring 3, and although I faced a minor battery issue, the customer service was outstanding.

Non-existent customer service.,"Non-existent customer service.I placed an order for an Oura 4 last week. It appears that they opt for the slowest / cheapest shipping options and they are not very transparent about timeframes (or at least they are leaving it intentionally vague). I find it unbelievable that they are allowed to not have a complaints process or a clear way to communicate with the company and instead re-direct you to FAQs and chats with BOTs which do not even function. After I placed an order and paid almost £600 (which they happily took out of my account much quicker than they sent the trial kit), and after not seeing much movement through the tracking link I received, I wanted to try and find out whether I would be likely to receive the product within a certain date. There is no email or form to fill out for customer support, which if not illegal, is still unacceptable for a product of this price range. I sent an email to their ""orders@...."" address which has a convenient (for Oura) automated response that this inbox is not monitored.This whole experience actually made me cancel my order since I have not even received the sizing kit 5BD after placing the order. They'd better be as quick in refunding me as they were in taking the money out of the account.",1,2024-12-05T13:00:06.000Z,Anastasia,GB,1.0

They did not send tracking information. The info I had said that they were using DHL but they used the USPS.   They just delivered the ring to a street mailbox at 10pm. I can’t believe this company. I would not purchase directly from them. I would use Amazon, Target or Best Buy as they have much better delivery. I also am not sure I would have purchased this ring after this delivery and their terrible answers to questions about this order.I hope the set up goes smoothly, but I’m skeptical. Now Oura reached out, but the email that they gave in the response is not valid. SO THEIR RESPONSE IS NOT ACCURATE AND THEY ARE TRYING TO SAVE FACE.

Horrendous Oura Care Team,I am still waiting for Jake from the Oura Social Care Team to provide a satisfactory resolution after supplying the extra information requested. Is it really that difficult to give a refund to switch from a yearly to monthly membership? I am very disappointed with the level of customer service that a supposedly reputable company like Oura is providing presently.Oura needs to step up and treat their customers better.Oura's customer service is next to non-existence. I bought the Oura ring 4 and added a 12 months membership at the same time. Two weeks into my  free month trial I reached out to customer service to ask for a refund of the yearly membership so I could switch to a monthly membership instead. An Oura Care Team member (Ken) came back and said it was a complex issue requiring the attention of one of their specialist.

The customer service is horrendous, and the product is unreliable. I highly recommend steering clear of this purchase.PS.

I went through the roundabout customer service journey by messaging in the app and almost 2 weeks later I am still waiting for a response from a warranty team member. Several days between any messages and completely generic, AI- like responses. Appalled with the customer service from Oura for the price I paid for this new Gen 4 ring.

I sent an email to Oura about a possible battery replacement (I'd even pay for the service.) and received a reply that the email address is no longer valid an to use the ""Help Center"".After trying several times and using the automated chat (""FInn""), I got nowhere.

"Misleading Information, Poor Customer Service, and Unresolved Issue","I ordered a product from Ōura in October 2021, with a promise of delivery in 3-4 weeks. However, the order was never shipped. When I reached out for an explanation, Ōura claimed that sanctions imposed against Russia were preventing the shipment.The problem is that Ōura has been giving me misleading information. They claimed sanctions began in November 2021, but in reality, the first sanctions that could have impacted their operations were imposed after February 22, 2022, months after I placed my order. Additionally, the sanctions are against Russia, not individuals like me. I am not personally sanctioned, and I have been living in the UAE (a non-sanctioned country) for over two years.Ōura also claims they cannot ship my order to an alternate address or provide a refund, even though I am now living in the UAE. Their responses have been inconsistent, and their refusal to resolve the issue has raised concerns that they are acting more like scammers than a reputable company.Despite numerous attempts to communicate and resolve the issue, they have ignored my requests and failed to provide a satisfactory solution. This has been a frustrating experience, and I would strongly advise others to think twice before purchasing from Ōura, especially if they expect any transparency or accountability when issues arise.",1,2024-10-22T20:29:50.000Z,Alexander Morozov,AE,1.0

In Love with Oura,"I've had my Oura ring for almost a year and it just keeps getting better! The app and ring both updated in the last couple weeks and I am blown away! I now have the Oura advisor which is like having a personal trainer/ advisor in my pocket to answer questions. For example, some days I have trouble choosing between different workouts and have started turning to the advisor. Because it has access to the data in my app, it notices trends and patterns and can give me the best recommendation! A number of the metrics are even more accurate now such as HRV, resilience, stress, and more. I LOVE how it tracks great taste data through my workouts because, now, it breaks my heart rate down into zones! The app also has a whole new layout which I wasn't sure about but I really do like.I could go on for pages about all the reasons that I love the Oura ring and app. All I've done here is hit the highlights of the newest update. I didn't think it was possible for this to get better and it did! Oura works consistently, reliably and extremely well. I cannot recommend it highly enough. As an aside, I think Oura is an amazing testament to Finland and the Finnish people. They have truly created a product that empowers everyday people, like myself, to better understand and improve our health. It has even helped with my complex PTSD. The resilience and stress graphing are accurate and phenomenal! Thank you for creating a product, and making it affordable, that has so clearly shown how mental/emotional and physical health interact with each other!",5,2024-10-17T18:52:50.000Z,Bryoney Blakley,US,1.0
A Two-Year Member Completely Ignored – Disgraceful Service,"After two years of being a loyal Oura member, to clarify I've had an active membership for 2+ years, I’m beyond disgusted with the customer service. You'd think that being a paying member for this long would warrant even the slightest bit of attention, but clearly, OURA couldn’t care less about its customers once they've got your money.I've reached out multiple times and was met with nothing but radio silence. For a company that markets itself as cutting-edge and customer-centric, this is absolutely pathetic. No response, no support, and zero respect for their members.I sent several emails, reached out on social media, on chat etc. If you're thinking about buying an OURA ring, take my advice: save yourself the frustration.

Now, even if I charge it right before sleep, the battery is dead by morning and doesn’t show any data. I need to charge the ring twice a day, and some data is still missing in the morning. I contacted support, and they said they would send me a new ring, but they keep delaying it because the ring is out of stock in their warehouse, and they aren’t providing any alternative. They apologized and gave me an extra 6 months on top of the subscription, but that doesn’t solve the issue with the faulty ring.",1,2024-10-16T08:44:44.000Z,Meda Mačiulaitytė,LT,1.0
Avoid Oura at All Costs – Terrible Customer Service and Unresolved Issues,"I strongly advise against purchasing from Oura. Our experience has been nothing short of a nightmare.We ordered Oura Rings, paying nearly $1,000, but never received the package due to it being lost by UPS. Despite this, Oura has been unhelpful and continues to hold us accountable for the lost package. They refuse to issue a refund or replacement until they ""locate"" the lost shipment. To make matters worse, they offered refurbished rings as replacements, even though we paid full price for new ones. This is simply absurd and unacceptable.Their customer service has been slow, unresponsive, and dismissive, and it has now been weeks without any resolution. We've had to take matters into our own hands by disputing the charge with our credit card company.Oura's handling of this situation shows a complete disregard for their customers. I will never recommend this brand to anyone and will actively share this experience to warn others. Save yourself the frustration and buy from a company with actual customer services",1,2024-10-12T18:22:55.000Z,Msryan,US,5.0
Poor customer service and terrible gifting experience,"Really disappointing experience trying to gift Oura Ring. Their checkout process doesn't tell you that if it's an international shipment, the receiver could have to pay customs.. The gift receiver then got the ring + a $70 bill. What a crapy gifting experience. The customer success team spend all their time blaming me for not seeing a ""customs"" notice and I've sent them screenshots of the flow and it doesn't exist on the checkout like they keep claiming. Then they have the gall to reach out and ask me to refer Oura to others. Tone deaf and absolutely dumb. A simple way of keeping a new customer is just to solve for the crappy experience. They could've just offered a free annual membership (cost of $80) to the gift receiver to really win them over. Instead they continue arguing via email and claiming the customer is the idiot.

Above and beyond experience,"I reached out to costumer support in regards to my ring. This ring was a gift given to me and I explained to the team that my ring just stopped working. The team was able to run a diagnosis on my ring and determined that it was a software issue. Unfortunately, I have had this ring for around 2 years, about three years, so I had no warranty on the ring since it is only given on the first year after your purchase. Luckily, an amazing customer service representative named Bryan offered to exchange my ring at no additional cost, even with the warranty expired! He was able to guide me through the process of how the exchange would work, and I was more than satisfied! He was even able to send me a free sizing kit since my ring also did not fit me anymore due to health issues. After the sizing kit arrived, I was able to reach out to customer service again, and the attention was unmatched. Erwin was able to help me through the process of ordering the exchange ring; he was very patient, and thoughtful. It was a very pleasant experience.

Get a device from somewhere else.,"I just dont know if I trust this company. The product is incredibly expensive and I havent been able to get support. My roommate was able to exchange her ring for the new generation no problem and I have yet to get a response. Additionally, I was having troubles with the app and there has been no response there either. I bought my ring through amazon (only because oura's website HSA Payment portal does not work and hasnt for a long time) and when I reached out to them about the exchange they acted as a completely separate entity and denied the exchange even though ouras website would allow it. Oura shouldnt advertise external sellers on their site if they dont abide by the company's policies. Additionally, if it was their fault that I couldn't get it from their website in the first place, I shouldn't be responsible for that. It needs to be more consistent. I've heard and seen so many people struggling to get proper help and support from customer service and it just doesn't seem worth it. 400-500 dollars is a lot to invest when there are plenty of other devices on the market. If they want to compete with apple they need to be more reliable. I wish I had never bought one.

More data would be beneficial,"I’ve been using your product for some time now and have enjoyed it quite a bit. I initially chose it because of its reputation as one of the most accurate sleep trackers and, secondly, because the design is sleek and attractive, unlike many other bulky devices.However, after extended use, I find that it doesn’t provide enough data for my needs, and I don’t want to rely on an additional app for more insights. For instance, I also use the RISE app, which calculates sleep depth and provides energy peaks and dips based on wake-up times—data that is missing from Oura. I believe integrating such features would greatly enhance the product's value.Here are three suggestions I think would improve Oura:Sleep Depth and Energy Patterns: Adding sleep depth analysis and energy level tracking throughout the day would provide more insight into sleep quality. It would also eliminate the need for users to use additional paid apps like RISE for this data.Smart Alarm Integration: A smart alarm feature that wakes users at the most optimal time, based on their sleep cycle, would be highly beneficial. For instance, allowing the user to set a latest wake-up time, and the app waking them up at the best point within their sleep cycle, would improve the overall experience.Customizable Insights and Feedback: Adding an option for users to input how they feel throughout the day (e.g., energy levels, mood) and giving recommendations (e.g., when to stop drinking coffee) would offer more personalized feedback and allow Oura to collect data that could enhance future analyses.As someone with nearly a decade of experience in brand management and startups, I believe these improvements would make Oura even more powerful. I hope this feedback helps in your product development, and I look forward to seeing future updates. Thank you for the work you're doing!",4,2024-10-07T10:47:53.000Z,Julianna Bebre,LV,1.0

I use a Garmin for running, hiking, and swimming, which syncs data nicely with Oura. More recently I'm finding it helpful in tracking perimenopause, the other side of cycle monitoring. After noticing the ring battery decreasing from close to 7 days down to 2ish days, a quick check-in with customer service has resulted in them sending me a replacement ring, no hassles, and very prompt communication which I appreciate.

Terrible customer service and brand support,"I have to agree with some of the other poor reviews on this site - for all the promise of the product, the customer service is absolutely lousy.

We now have no product nor our refund issued.We have now sent 4 emails on this matter and no reply nor resolution.I am having to report this to our bank as this seems like a real scam product and company - I am sorry to say.I suggest the Trading Standards and Police need to investigate Oura for criminal activity asap and their partners, such as John Lewis, need to truly question whether they want their brand associated with a brand like this.",1,2024-09-28T11:49:29.000Z,Baz,GB,1.0
Bad battery and lousy customer service.,I have loved the insights from the ring but that is not last long. Just 3 months the battery is depleting very fast and cause me to miss too many data. Contacting the customer service only face with more disappointment as they can’t fix the ring though it is still within the warranty and the last i heard is they are checking my warranty status. It’s been more than 2 weeks since i last heard from them and in the meantime the membership fee can’t be cancelled. Very disappointed. And it’s more so now that i see so many unhappiness with their customer service. It seems there is no further escalation to this unresponsive customer service. This company doesn’t focus in having good customer service. I guess u just say good bye to money spent on this. Bad decision to buy the his ring.,1,2024-09-28T06:53:57.000Z,Belinda Sutan,SG,1.0

I am incredibly unsatisfied with the…,"I am incredibly unsatisfied with the service I have received from Oura Ring. Despite purchasing the product a long time ago while residing in Russia, I encountered shipping constraints that prevented delivery. Now, having relocated to the UK, the customer support team has persistently refused to ship the product or provide a refund to any bank account. Since relocating to the UK, I have reached out to customer support multiple times asking for a resolution, only to be refused each time. Their only offer was a $50 token for a discount on a future purchase, which, considering the circumstances, is no consolation as I will not be making any further purchases from themThis level of inflexibility and lack of customer care is appalling and has left me feeling incredibly frustrated and disheartened. I advise potential customers to be cautious when dealing with Oura Ring, as their after-sales support is severely lacking.my order number is SO-10541461",1,2024-09-27T12:24:16.000Z,Ася Стеценко,RU,1.0

Beware of the five star reviews here, they all look fake due to lack of specific info and that most of them have only one review.

I returned within 30 days for the Horizon style (no angles) in Rose Gold, it arrived in unsealed box with two scratches on the ring.  I tried it and like it and figured I could like with the scratches as they were on side and underneath so not visible.  3 days after the 30 day return period, the ring malfunctions and won't download my info.  A few days later the charger malfunctions and constantly blinks orange and does not charge the ring. I look at online reviews and this blinking orange has been a problem for YEARS.  I am now trying to return the malfunctioning ring that was sent to me used and scratched.  On my sixth email to the company and still no progress.  Honestly do not buy it. My husband thinks it's a scam and is quite happy using his Apple Watch for health/activity/sleep info. Unfortunately I just cannot sleep with a watch on my wrist.

Unreliable Performance and Poor Customer Service,"I had high hopes for the Oura Ring and was excited to track my health more closely. However, since purchasing the ring, I’ve experienced recurring issues with the app not providing readiness scores and what seems like partial syncing. As a result, I regularly miss out on important data. I’ve contacted Oura’s customer support about this issue, but their response is painfully slow. Each time, I’ve had to go through a lengthy and frustrating process of deleting the app, turning my phone on and off, reinstalling the app, and resetting everything just to get it working temporarily. It’ll function for a few weeks, but then the same problem arises, and I have to repeat the entire process. For a £450 ring, on top of a monthly subscription, this is extremely disappointing. I really wanted to love this product and recommend it, but the constant technical issues and slow customer service have left me feeling ripped off.

Very poor support,"Less than a day after I activated my ring, it stopped working, ie synching was completely dead. It took a week for their customer service team to acknowledge that their troubleshooting does not work. They said their warranty team will reach out, and I still have not heard from them. As a customer service professional, I think this is an extremely poor experience which makes me think the product is 💩 too. Unfortunately, I can’t say anything good or bad about the ring because it was not working 😡Upd: Oura care team tries to leave an impression that they care by leaving a comment here, but in reality I still have not heard back 2 days later - neither from support nor from warranty team. With a monthly app charge issues like this one has to be taken care of immediately, not a week or two later (or who knows how long).

We are in NZ and ordered an ŌURA ring…,"Hi there this is a follow up from Original review.  I got a reply from you guys on this site and you said someone will contact me re my concerns, still nothing.  I have now cancelled my order for the ring and cannot see how I can cancel the membership, a lot of hoops to just through to get into the right box and wont accept my email address etc to login in.  Anyway have not received any communication from Oura at all over all of this except Bot messages.  I have spent a lot of money and trusted Oura to be reputable , how wrong was I! We are in NZ and ordered an ŌURA ring from the Oura website 10 days ago and ordered the sizing rings.  Paid in full for the ring and membership.  We received an email to say our orders were received and we would get email re the sizing rings delivery.  WE have had nothing except their regular newsletters etc.  When I messaged to ask what is happening I get the bot reply to say should get reply in 24 hours.  Nothing for 3 days now.  I sent more messages and then just get standard message with ticket number from Anna?? Who is obviously not a person as she does not answer my question just gives me another ticket number and has escalated my request and finding someone with expertise to  address the complexities of my case!  I just want to know if and when it will be sent, not complicated at all, just standard procedure when I have purchased something I would have thought! Communication terrible from them.  Will be cancelling my order in the next 24 hours if not updated.  I did not realise it would be this hard.

Exceptional Customer Care - They Truly Stand Behind Their Products,"I’ve been using my Oura ring for 2.5 years now and can confidently say that if I lost my ring tomorrow, I would instantly be ordering a new one.

Terribly inaccurate,"While the metrics are impressive, they are only as good as the accuracy of the underlying data.  Sleep data is embedded in much of the analysis….and it is terribly inaccurate. Consistently drops 2+ hours of sleep at the start of sleep cycle.  My Apple Watch, while it does little analysis with the data, is far more accurate than the oura ring. Step counts are also significantly overstated, skewing other analysis.  Buyer beware!Adding on 9/11.  I appreciate the support and request for additional information from Oura,  however response requires a reference number which is not evident.

I was frustrated by the pace but that lies with me and not Õura, who were so appologetic for my frustration and gave my 3 months free subscription which I really appreciated.

I'd assumed I had the ring long enough that it was out of warranty, and I figured the poor battery performance was just the inevitable consequence of battery technology coupled with time.

My first ticket is now open for nearly 5 days without any reply. There is no other possibility to contact oura. Also, when returning the ring from certain countries you have to contact customer support but when they do not answer, it might happen that the 14 days/30 days for returns is over.

Amazing customer service for an out of warranty ring,"I bought my gen 3 Heritage model ring in late Nov 2021. The last few weeks the battery wasn't holding a charge for more than a day and many nights I got no sleep data because the battery died in the night. I emailed support to ask about this, fully expecting to be told my ring was out of warranty and that's what happens when the ring gets old. Much to my surprise, that is not what I was told. They said they identified an issue with my ring and I was offered $75 off a new ring of any model, or I could opt to receive a restored ring, same model as the one I have. I was amazed!! My ring is out of warranty but because I am a member of the Oura community, I was offered this one time exception. This is customer service at it's finest.

AVIOD !!,"I have been an Oura ring customer since the beginning in 2020.  The battery life in these rings (including the new GEN3) is extremely short , no matter how careful you are in charging it.  My first GEN3 ring was replaced due to battery issues with no problem.  However my most recent ring also developed battery issues and Oura told me over a month ago that is was being replaced since it was still under warranty.  Whenever I try to contact them (email only, that is the only option), they give me a new ticket number and inform me that the ring is on its way.  It should not take a month to send a ring!!  Additionally,  I question the accuracy of the metrics such as sleep score, readiness, heart rate variability, and ""resilience"".  They don't really correlate well with how I feel and I have been using the ring for over 4 years.  I find that the information is not very actionable.  For example , it may say ""your heart rate variability is below your baseline for the past 7 days"".  I dont change anything and the HRV goes back to its ""baseline"".",1,2024-08-24T15:45:57.000Z,Customer,US,2.0

Middling tracker in a sea of new alternatives,"I've been an Oura customer for a long time, and I would rate the product as reasonable and the service as middling.I wouldn't normally review a company I view as middling, but I submitted some feedback to them the other day about a problem with their heart rate tracking feature for exercise and received a message back that  essentially said (in flowery language), your too unintelligent to understand the data, it's not the ring.Lovely as it was for them to insult my intelligence, all it earned them was a review!Batteries fail far too regularly, heart rate tracking is broken, the new automatic activity tracking makes up activities and the sleep tracking once tracked my sleep and heart rate while I had lost it in a car park.Perhaps it is you dear customer support representative who is too unintelligent to understand!

Purchased my ring on 1/23/24,"Purchased my ring on 1/23/24, and contacted Oura in May as the finish was completely gone from the ring. After pictures and multiple back and forth they blamed Best Buy, and said I’d need to take it up with them. After months of back and forth with Best Buy, they have reiterated time and time again that only Oura can send me a return authorization number and/or file a warranty claim. Best Buy has nothing to do with that. Since contacting them in May, the ring has essentially stopped charging at all. So I have a $500 useless item that’s only 9 months old, and ouras customer service has been an absolute joke to deal with. I’ll be filling a claim with my credit card company next, as this is absolutely ridiculous.",1,2024-08-21T23:13:02.000Z,Ashley Yibale,US,1.0

I opted for a replacement, but unfortunately, the new ring has yet to be shipped, and my follow-up emails have gone unanswered.As a loyal customer, I'm deeply disappointed by the lack of communication and resolution.

"Lightning fast, no hassle replacement","After experiencing a battery issue, Oura responded swiftly and sent out a replacement under my warranty with very little effort on my part. I am impressed and will be able to recommend Oura ring with even more confidence now. I purchased my Oura ring just under 2 years ago and have absolutely loved it. Recently, it seemed like the battery life was less efficient than it had been but I did not think much of it until on August 7 I received a notification from the app to charge my ring before bed. This was odd as I had fully charged the ring just that morning. I opened the app and found that the ring battery was extremely low. I fully charged it and put it back on around 8pm. I went to bed later that night and woke up in the around 2am with a headache. I opened my Oura app to see if I had any alerts about my temperature, and found that the ring had died. I put it back on the charger and went back to sleep. When I woke up around 6am EST, I googled the issue and saw someone posting about how they received a replacement with a similar issue when they were under warranty still. I couldn't remember how long my warranty was when I purchased it, but I went to the help feature in the Oura app and followed the steps with the AI help chat. It walked me through a simple process after saying that the app detected a battery issue with the ring and while retrieving some of the requested information and I found my warranty email from my purchase stating that the ring has a two year warranty. It turned out that my warranty's expiration date was just 10 days away. The help ticket was sent and I received a confirmation email saying I would receive a response within 24 hours about the next steps. The next day, I awoke to find that Oura support had responded saying they would replace my ring AND I had another email notifying me that the replacement had already been shipped and would arrive in three days. Since I use Oura ring paired with Natural Cycles, this quick turnaround is incredible and appreciated. I feel 100% taken care of as a customer and believe the value of Oura's product is increased by the simple fact that they stand by their quality standards and actually make it easy to activate the warranty when an issue arises.",5,2024-08-10T02:31:57.000Z,Anna Caton,US,1.0

Expensive Piece of Kit,"I am still aggravated over the initial cost of the ring and then the monthly fee to use the app on top of that. Which if you don't pay for, the ring is essentially an expensive piece of useless ornamentation.  That all being said, I find the metrics that are provided to be very useful, even though I grumble a lot.  When the battery started acting up and barely made it through a full day without running out of juice, I contacted them and they ran a remote test on the ring and determined that the battery had failed and told me that they would replace it without charge. However, it is a one-time warranty repair and the ring will no longer be covered in the future.  The response was fast and the people were very helpful in getting a resolution and doing it quickly without need to get lots of up-line approvals. I am always impressed by companies who empower their customer service people to resolve issues for their customers.  My only quibble at this point is that I wish I could purchase a yearly plan for the app, rather than pay full price every month.",4,2024-08-09T06:29:33.000Z,Don “By-tor” Hamilton,US,1.0

Best Customer service experience ever!!,"I would like to express my utmost admiration for the exceptional customer service provided by Joe from the Oura team. Recently, I encountered issues with my ring, and Joe demonstrated unparalleled proficiency in guiding me through the troubleshooting process and facilitating a swift replacement. His efficiency and depth of knowledge were remarkable, underscoring his commitment to delivering exemplary service. Joe exemplifies the epitome of outstanding customer support, showcasing Oura's dedication to customer satisfaction and product reliability. As a result of this positive experience, I have confidently invested in another ring for my wife, who has medical conditions, and it has proven to be an invaluable investment in our well-being.Joe, thank you from the bottom of our hearts you are a perfect example of what it means to care for your customers, I will continue to be a loyal customer as well as all my family.

Never Buy Oura Ring,"Wow, what a waste of money! Over £300 on a ring which lasts about 3 years before not working, and is out of warranty, so they basically are charging you £100 per year! The ridiculous part was it never worked 24/7 and was only used at night, so they offered me £75 off a new ring - as if I would ever buy another one! Apparently there are so many people in this situation it is being investigated, but I am trying to verify who/when/how.

NOT WORTH IT!!,"My wife bought me an Oura ring for my birthday just over two years ago. Not cheap at £275 plus just under £6 per month to subscribe to their monitoring app. Initially, I loved this product. They state that the battery can last a week before needing to be recharged. Then a few months ago, the time before recharge started to diminish. The ring has now failed completely and is out of the one year warranty.

Battery degrading / planned obsolescence,"EDIT: This was a firmware issue and I freaked out because of the timing of it all. The battery still doesn't last as long as I would like but I understand that battery technology is limited. It now last 1 - 3 days I'm having a similar experience with the battery except i only had a 1 year warranty, literally few days after the warranty expired the battery started going down hill. It still charges and has a bit of life in it but if it keeps degrading by this rate it only last a few months max. It seems all too convenient and reeks of planned obsolescence, especially since SO many people have had the same experience (there's reddit threads full of it)The responses to the reviews regarding the batteries here are super frustrating and show how bad this company is, of course batteries degrade over time but if your selling a product for such a insane ammount of money ensure it is able to be repaired not just obsolete. It also is a shocking business stratergy if for every persons whos ring dies, them plus how ever many other people they told boycott oura. Hopefully the samsung ring doesn't have the same problem.

"Bad product, bad customer service, bad experience","Initially, the product worked well. After 6 to 8 months, I experienced major issues with heart rate detection. Customer service informed me that it was a software update issue and that I needed to be patient. After waiting 4 months, I requested a refund and/or an exchange. I was then told that the problem was not with the product, but likely a contraindication with my fingers. They reluctantly offered a refund. Some time later, the sensor started working more or less well again. After 1 year and 6 months, the battery was definitively out of service. Customer service informed me that they would do nothing except offer a 70$ voucher. Oura lost a happy customer and gained a dissatisfied one. I'm taking the time to warn others, so be cautious with your purchase and be prepared to pay for a new ring every 2 years. Apparently, the subscription is not enough for this company, which should better review its priorities and focus on its customers, rather than wasting time with legal procedures against competitors who are likely doing better. I do not recommend it.Edit 12/08/24: After sending an email the 30 july and more informations to Oura, the customer service said they will exchange under warranty the ring. But, today, I received a message from the Warranty agent they said no exchange under Warranty. Here is the customer service you will get when purchasing an Oura product.

Review of my Oura ring after 18 months,"Had my Oura ring now for 18 months. Feb of 2024 it started to act weird, showing that I walked 6.8 miles when in fact it was about 2 miles. Then it kept showing that my steps per day were higher than actual as compared to a treadmill or Google watch. I called the company, they have you reset the ring and then literally put on the charger and slam it down on a solid surface!! REALLY??  So I did all that they recommended and still nothing. They finally said they would send this issue up to the next level so they could give me a solution....THATS BEEN 4 MONTHS NOW!! I email every month and get the same canned response...sorry for your issue we are working on a solution.  I asked for a replacement and they said the ring can be fixed so they won't replace?? BUT they still have not come up with a solution... In the meantime I am walking 15000 steps which really is about 9000....

Outstanding customer service - free ring replacement after 2.5 years,"I’ve had an Oura ring for 3 years now.My first one broke after 6 months and they replaced for free.My second lasted for 2.5 years, and has recently not been holding its battery. Again they have replaced it for free, no questions asked.There are a lot of reviews saying they haven’t had the same level of customer service. And if that is the case then those reviews are justified.But in my experience they’ve been outstanding and gone above & beyond what I would have expected them to do. And that too deserves to be called out.Aside from that the ring and the data are excellent, and have hugely helped in helping me improve my sleep, life and fitness. The ring itself won’t make the changes for you, you have to do it, but the data helps you stay on track and monitor how different actions affect your well being and health.",5,2024-05-31T13:36:31.000Z,Ben,GB,4.0

They don't last more than two years and if they do it's no longer warrantied. That means they don't stand behind their product and you're spending basically $150 per year for the 2yrs it's good for. Then they switched over to charging for the app if you weren't one of the original buyers. They only care about the bottom dollar, their customer support is trash, and honestly the cost vs the value is not there. You can't lift weights with the ring because it will scratch so it is really only for sleep.I bought a Galaxy watch that has far more functionality and make more sense just to use that. I'm disappointed at the fact all they do is offer $50-$75 to buy another ring to have the same problem in a year.",1,2024-05-18T14:18:04.000Z,Mikepi,US,1.0

Giving as a gift is bad experience,"Ring is good, but giving as a gift is pretty bad experience -- literally the first thing Oura requires of your gift recipient do to, is pls make an account and enter your payment details to start paying monthly or annual fee. Please note I'm not against the subscription business model and the ring is fine, but the way Oura handles new members is really worst user experience you can think of when gift recipients are concerned. While probably existing users giving it could be one of the best ways for Oura to grow. In summary, beware when thinking about buying for someone else 1) giving prepaid subscription together with the ring as a gift is not possible 2) paying for another member is possible via Paypal or card so that another person has to create the account and then you have to put your payment details to his/her account, absurd approach for a modern healthtech company 3) activating the ring without starting subscription trial is not possible.

I then had to contact customer support to exchange my ring, as I ordered the wrong size. I received a reply within 24 hours to each of my messages. They organised the exchange of the ring and again, shipped within 2 days and now receiving the new ring in less than 7 days. Great service!",5,2024-02-19T20:38:49.000Z,Lara,GB,6.0
Excellent all around,"I've had an Oura ring since mid 2021. The ring has worked extremely well and provided helpful information. Customer service has been exceptional.I purchased the ring to help with sleep tracking, as at the time I was dealing with severe insomnia and fatigue. Feedback from my Oura ring helped me to understand differences between my perceptions of wakefulness and my physiological rest/wake times. This was invaluable as I used behavioral, environmental, and pharmacological interventions to build better sleep. Information from my ring has become better over time as well, with more nuanced feedback over the years. I assume this comes both from improvements in Oura's algorithms and from longitudinal data from my own ring. My sleep and health are now much improved thanks in part to feedback from my Oura ring. Beyond sleep tracking, the information Oura provides has been interesting, though not life-changing. I'm grateful for some of the insights about which days of the week I tend to have more inactive time, and the temperature sensor has been informative at times that I have been ill.My experience with customer service has been outstanding. First, I was fortunate to receive an upgrade from gen 2 to gen 3 due to the timing of my initial purchase. The timing and offer for upgrade were purely lucky on my part, but really awesome on the part of Oura. Then, just recently (after 2.5 years of use), I experienced some battery longevity issues with my ring. I contacted Oura customer service online, and they replaced my ring immediately and free of charge.In summary, my Oura ring has been well worth it to me. The functionality has been extremely beneficial to my health, and their customer service has been extraordinary.",5,2024-02-18T17:55:11.000Z,Beth Ann Turner,US,1.0

Do not purchase if you have AFib,We bought the ring hoping to keep a good eye on my husband's heart rate due to AFib. We didn't expect it to be any kind of medical device but we thought we could get a constant reading of his heart rate which would be useful for his doctors. We were unaware that it will not take your heart rate if your heart rate is erratic.

Scam Chinese knockoff- Oura Ring,"After eagerly purchasing the Oura Ring, I couldn't be more disappointed. Not only is this so-called 'smart' ring a blatant knockoff of higher quality products, but it's also trash from China. The design is uninspired, resembling a cheap plastic toy rather than a sophisticated wearable. Not to mention, the functionality is severely lacking. The sleep tracking is wildly inaccurate, often mistaking moments of restlessness for deep sleep, leaving me feeling misled and frustrated. Additionally, the activity tracking is laughable, as it fails to accurately capture my steps and activity levels, making it essentially useless for monitoring my fitness progress.

"Probably, the worst customer service in the world","Edit: Changed to 4 stars because they eventually resolved the issue and I received the replacement ring. Only buy if you will never interact with customer support. What will happen with the smallest question - you will get in an endless email chain. Every answer will be a “non-answer” seemingly written with someone who has vague understanding of English. But it will always end with the friendly “Let us know if you have any other questions!”. I have now been waiting for my replacement ring (clearly confirmed by Oura that it will be delivered in the end of 2021) for TWO AND A HALF years. I exchange some 50 emails once a year, then get tired and then try again. This time they confirmed that the ring has been sent out. They sent a tracking number (that did not work). Then they promised to send a new tracking number. Then they asked for my address 4 times. Then they said that they will send another ring. Then, two days ago, they wrote that they have never sent out the replacement ring. The customer support is either outsourced to people with lacking English, or it’s a very poor AI. Given a chance, I would never buy the ring again.",4,2024-08-07T12:17:19.000Z,Alice,SE,6.0
Lemon Oura Ring: Cautionary Tale & BUYER BEWARE,"My experience with the Oura Ring has been marred by a series of issues that have left me thoroughly dissatisfied. Two weeks after my initial purchase, I encountered problems with the battery life, which was consistently lasting only 30-36 hours despite the advertised claim of 7 days.Concerned about the discrepancy, I promptly requested a replacement. To my dismay, I was told that the battery was functioning within acceptable parameters and that the variation in battery life depended on individual usage patterns and the selected modes. It's worth noting that I was only using the ring for sleep tracking at that time. In every correspondence, I explicitly noted my request for a replacement.Despite this early red flag, I continued to face persistent challenges with sleep tracking accuracy. Each attempt to address the issue and request a replacement, clearly noting the need for a replacement due to the ongoing sleep tracking problems, was met with resistance from Oura's customer support.My saga with the Oura Ring took a turn for the worse in July 2023 when my ring began randomly failing to track my sleep. This prompted a series of interactions with customer support that only added to my mounting frustration.After a lot of back-and-forth, in September 2023, I was finally informed that the sleep tracking issue was a ""known issue"" and that the company was actively working on a resolution. However, it wasn't until January 4, 2024, that I received an email claiming the problem had been resolved and instructing me to update my ring.Unfortunately, the latest update proved ineffective, and the situation escalated. Customer support guided me through a series of steps, including taking screenshots, in an attempt to troubleshoot. Regrettably, these efforts rendered my ring completely non-functional, and the ring now refuses to connect to the app.Astoundingly, despite the ongoing and unresolved issues, the company maintained that my Oura Ring was now out of warranty. Today their proposed solution remained a meager $75 off a new purchase, a response that does little to address the persistent problems and the impact on my overall experience. They refuse to acknowledge that the problem starting in July has not been resolved, and that I requested a replacement every step of the way.This extended ordeal with the Oura Ring has left me not only with a malfunctioning device but also with a sense of disappointment in the company's ability to deliver reliable products and satisfactory customer support. Potential customers should approach the Oura Ring with caution, considering alternative options with a more proven track record and responsive support. A strong buyer beware is warranted. If you do decide to purchase the Oura Ring, and encounter issues early on, it's imperative to insist on a replacement. My experience revealed that the company may run you in circles, offering resistance and delaying tactics until the warranty period expires. It's essential to advocate for your rights as a consumer and seek a resolution promptly to avoid prolonged frustrations and potential lapses in warranty coverage.",1,2024-01-18T09:09:04.000Z,Jessie S,US,1.0
"Good idea, badly priced","Long time fan of the OURA ring idea... Had my eyes on it for ages, but refused due to the Membership for data policy. The Good:Excellent ring, light weight, well designed and surprising to have all the sensors needed in it. The buying process was excellent. In the UK we don't have bestbuy, so we have to order the sizers when we buy our ring. The Bad:The ring is £383.28 in the UK (with current conversion) and that is before import tariffs of £81.98 are added (because the company do not correctly file UK VAT). So a total of £405.26 for a ring with the same features as a £250 smart watch. But there is more. Then you have to pay £5.99 a month just to use that data properly. Including preventing you from importing that data into other apps unless you pay. This is clearly a money making scheme and close to a scam holding your data ransom... Except that they give you the ability to download the data manually. The Ugly:A year of owning the ring will set you back £405.26 + £71.88... Think about that before you buy the ring. For some people this will be a valid price, for others the *hidden membership fee and shipping tariff will make it unviable.*Technically not hidden, it does show up on their site, but it isn't well sign posted well enough and the tariff was not highlighted at all. Personally, I am keeping the ring and considering it a sunk cost. I will return to update this review if anything spectacular or shocking happens. I am still unsure if I will continue with the membership.Edit same day: Decided to contact Oura support with the points raised, will feed back if anything is responded to.",1,2024-01-16T15:31:06.000Z,William John MacLeod Fraser,GB,28.0
I give it two stars because the sleep…,"I give it two stars because the sleep tracking seems to be very accurate.The activity tracking is off by a lot, 25-50% undercounts of walking distance/steps. I got this as a gift, sized to my ring finger. They did send a sizing plastic rings box. When I found the activity tracker underperforming, I ordered an exchange for an index finger ring, which is their recommended because of the shape relative to the knuckle. It didn’t make a difference.I contacted them to return for a refund after two weeks of activity and no improvement.I didn’t know about their one ring only exchange policy, that was my fault.I could potentially keep it as a sleep monitor only,  but not by paying a monthly membership.My recommendation is that if your ring doesn’t work well, return it for a full refund; and then start the process again with a new purchase if you want to try a different size.Versus, trying a different brand if the first one doesn’t work well (chances are the next one will be the same).",2,2024-01-14T21:53:14.000Z,alvaro segura,US,1.0

It decides that I'm asleep at times I know I am not asleep but just laying still so amount of sleep time overrated. It reported oxygen and breathing every day for a few months and then became inconsistent and reported most days, but not all days. Some days there will be no report and then the next day the previous day's report will magically show up or not. The battery does not last up to 7 days as they say, mine only has lasted till 4 days later from time it was new. Also, I'm pretty sure I didn't get the color I ordered.

Worst Customer Experience Possible,"I was gifted an Oura ring over a year ago by a friend.

As it's obvious, this is something that I do not have, nor can I ask since it was a gift. With my ring serial number, they could quickly get that information. Still, they will only provide me with support or replacement once I give this information (which I don't have).This is the type of support you can expect with Oura. Even when they recognize an issue with your ring, they will do anything to avoid going forward with a replacement and use any possible tricks to avoid any responsibility.",1,2024-01-07T12:09:51.000Z,JoS,PT,5.0

They are now telling me I can not return the ring because I have exchanged it once and it falls outside their return policy. The fact that a large company like Oura has such a poor return policy is absolutely ridiculous! No other tech company, that I have ever dealt with, has such a sorry excuse for a return policy.

Undisclosed Customs Charges,My wife ordered an OURA ring. Fortunately we kept the order acknowledgement which did not mention the DHL customs charges of £58. It merely said shipping £15 and taxes £0.I have complained to OURA but their e-mail address suddenly became “not monitored”. I have raised a dispute notice with AMEX as I don’t think this company are “straight” with their pricing structure. I would recommend anyone dealing with OURA to tread very carefully.

Hidden fees and battery issues,"I’ve been an Oura user for almost 3 years. Sadly I’ve had battery issues every year and had to change the ring twice which was painful but efficiently dealt with by the team at Oura. Although the reissue of the ring happens fairly smoothly this is simply not enough for a super premium (and super expensive) product. This process heavily impacts your data tracking as your ring battery dying and replacements will create huge gaps in your health monitoring.Nevertheless I’ve decided to give Oura another chance. I have bought my wife a brand new Gen3 but unfortunately I have rapidly learned things hadn’t changed at all.The ring shipped but I have just been asked to pay £56 in custom fees by DHL which I obviously am refusing to pay as the ring cost is already important and cannot sustain an extra fee like this. Surely the tax fees have to be covered by the seller. Or at least this heavy cost needs to be flagged clearly and loudly at the moment of buying the ring.This feels very cheeky and unfair, makes me feel like the company just wants your money and is ready to cut corners to get there. My situation is pretty awkward now because Oura is not answering my emails and DHL is demanding a heavy custom fee. I sincerely hope this heartfelt and sincere review catches their attention and solve this issue before Christmas. Otherwise I’ll end up with a wife without Christmas present under the tree. Goes without saying that I should have probably checked trust pilot before buying another ring. Didn’t realise Oura is rated 1.8 stars which is a worrying score if you want to deal with it as a consumer. Hopefully things will improve and the customer service can amend to this rather uncomfortable situation.",1,2023-12-19T12:24:09.000Z,Ugo Galelli,GB,4.0

Their return policy sucks,"Their return policy sucks...I exchanged my ring for a larger size...After trying it I decided to return it...it cannot be returned after 1 exchange, so if it doesn't fit correctly, just return it for a refund and then order another one.

Charge does NOT last!,My sister and mom had Oura rings so I bought a gold 400.00 ring. It did great for about six months than charge started to decrease faster and faster. The past year i have to charge just about daily. I found out last week that my mom and sister had same issues and had just got sent new ring due to problem. So i sent email with my problem and was told my warranty expired! My ring is the newest by far! Then they say they detected a problem and it started a month ago. BS it started a year ago! I was hoping their updates would fix the issue but they have not. Very unhappy with product. I could have got more reliable product for much less money.

POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Summary:  Customer service is like chatting to a bot.  No empathy, non-apologetic, and far from what one would expect from a premium product based on wellness.Detail:  Got gifted a ring in a style not to my liking.  Received the sizing kit and decided on a size.  Contacted their CS regarding wanting to change style/color.  Took 5 days to get a response (which was understandable due to the holiday).  However, I was advised they can't modify the order and the only option is to cancel and refund the original payment method.  Can't do a credit for me to apply towards a new purchase either.Poor practice with having a gifting structure aside.  Their customer service rep never apologized for the inconvenience, showed zero empathy, and just keep on repeating ""The only option is to cancel the order for the refund, which will be received in the form of payment used to purchase.""  I initially thought about giving the gift I got to a different family member and buying my own ring.  However, the lack of empathy from the customer service representative made it clear this company doesn't care about their customers.  So ""the only option"" it is and I requested to cancel the order.To add to this, trying to cancel the order through their website resulted in the error ""Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again later."".  I'm still awaiting confirmation on the refund and hope the gift giver gets his money back.",1,2023-12-01T22:11:54.000Z,TL,US,1.0

When my ring malfunctioned after 1,5 years if working perfectly they instantly sent me a new one.

I reported my concerns to Oura and they wanted me to follow about 8 steps on my own and provide them with screens shots and comparative data and it was just ludicrous. I think Oura is well aware that their product lacks motion detection. The only way it will count your move or exercise is if you manually add it. Don’t believe them when they say their product will automatically detect your motion or your activity. It seems to be a good sleep tracker and that is all it can do. One trick pony.

I was told they only offer a 30 day exchange period for ring sizes, despite my issues with the summer heat which was not detected in the first month of ring wear. The ring is not round. It has three large sensors inside the ring and this creates a lock on your finger that makes it difficult to remove. I truly believe this is a poor design and should be redesigned. They offered me a 10% discount to buy a new $400 ring. The also charge $6 a month for their app which you must have to get any level of stats. The app also does not track continuous pulse ox, so it will not iomport this data into Apple to be used by other apps  like Snorelab. For these reasons, I wasted and through my $400 ring in the trash can. I bought a Ringconn ring.

I did not realize that after the 1 month free membership you would be restricted to the most basic data scores. I have contacted them multiple times to ask them to treat my Gen 3 ring as a Gen 2 as I don’t need any of the new features. They were sympathetic but said their hands are tied. They offered me an additional three months free membership which I accepted but I will be discontinuing my relationship with Oura after this. I have recommened Oura to many friends and colleagues but I would jot do so now. Initially they offered me free Membership for life if I upgraded my Gen 2 to a Gen 3 on pre release but my Gen 2 was still new and I also did not have the funds to do so at that time nor did I see a reason why.

A Loyal Customer's Disappointment with Oura's New Paywall Strategy,"I've been a devoted Oura customer for four years and have recommended the ring to many friends and family members over that time. I've even upgraded my Oura ring twice, always excited to explore new features. However, my most recent experience with the Gen3 upgrade has been a sobering wake-up call that compels me to share my story.What Changed:After upgrading to the Gen3 ring, I was shocked to find out that the majority of features that were previously standard are now gated behind a subscription paywall. Even more unsettling is the fact that the historical health data that my wife and I have accumulated over years is now inaccessible unless we subscribe.Why This Matters:Lack of Transparency: There was no clear or adequate warning about this monumental shift in service terms. Depending on jurisdiction, this could pose a potential violation of consumer protection laws.Data Ethics: Health data is sensitive information. To lock it away from users who have contributed to that database over years is highly questionable from an ethical standpoint.Customer Loyalty Ignored: Oura's new business model feels like a betrayal to long-standing customers. Loyal users like us find ourselves stuck with a product that has suddenly lost most of its value.What Needs to Happen:I strongly urge Oura to reconsider this strategy. I suggest two possible remedies:Restore feature and data access to customers who have been with you before the introduction of this new subscription model.Provide a complete refund for recent Gen3 purchases made under the assumption of feature continuity.In the absence of timely redress, I'll be left with no choice but to escalate this issue through all available channels, including legal avenues and additional public forums.As much as it pains me to write this review, prospective customers need to know what they're getting into. And I hope Oura takes this as a wake-up call to realign their business practices with the ethics and transparency we expect from a health and wellness company.",1,2023-10-13T05:10:24.000Z,Alex Carpenter,PH,1.0
"I loved the 1st Gen Oura Ring, not the new one!","I loved the 1st Gen Oura Ring. After 3 years, the battery was quite deteriorated and I had to charge every night. Thus, I purchased a new one. Very disappointed to learn that the old version wasn't available anymore and that you had to get the fancy-schmancy new one with all the bells & whistles and 'membership fee.' I declined the membership immediately. I've been wearing the ring for almost 2 weeks now and there are two major issues (imho): 1- the ring glows green in the middle of the night! I get up to use the loo, get back in bed to try and go back to sleep, and then my finger starts glowing. WTH? I thought an alien had landed on my hand. It went off a few times and I thought ""I bought this ring to help me learn how to get better sleep. These LED lights going off in my totally dark room is doing just the opposite!"" 2- It isn't giving me my body temperature which is very important.Like everyone else here, I contacted Cust Serv and have received fairly quick responses. (now I know that is was AI I was hearing from- UGH!) They told me that there was no way to turn off the green LED lights. Are you kidding me? I wrote back that, had I known there was going to be flashing lights during the night, I never would have purchased. I didn't read anyone else complaining about this. Am I the only one it bothers?For the lack of temperature readings, I have to go through a million steps to try and resolve it. This includes uploading all of my ring's history to their website. Sorry, but I like to keep my own info private and have never uploaded anything to Oura other than my initial account info.I sent an email this morning saying that I cannot live with the alien lights at night and that I want to return. When they correct these flaws and come out with a new design, perhaps I will buy again. I truly loved the first Generation.

Worthless without a subscription,"Another potentially great company doubling-down on subscription model. The Ring I used would have been a 5/5, until I learned that they hamstring the phone app if you drop the subscription. DO NOT BUY until they change course, or they won't. We can't let every product we buy force us into continued payments. I understand R&D and ongoing tech support, but that's Oura's job to figure out. Not my job to pay for forever. But really, a  monthly subscription for a ring? Really?They don't make it obvious how terrible it is if you drop the subscription.

Unfortunately. Not worth it,"Unfortunately, the battery life is just not worth the high cost to purchase. There is a 2yr warranty, but I’ve barely had mine for under 3 years and the battery is done and won’t hold a charge. And trust me, I never left it on the charger for more than it needed; we all know how to care for rechargeable batteries. Customer service was friendly, and helpful, they gave an incentive coupon to purchase a new one, but when I don’t trust the long term quality, I’m not going to waste more money. Additionally, it never picked up my gym workouts, just all of my walking each day—so I had to manually add workouts each time. I’d save your money for the similarly priced, higher end equipment like watches, etc.",3,2023-10-09T19:22:48.000Z,Kayla,US,2.0

Look for something else unless only sleep data matters to you,"Been using the latest generation Oura ring since it was released. While there is no doubt this is a good sleep tracker the slick marketing pushing its usefulness as a overall Health Tracker and activity tracker is just that. I cancelled my membership today, which I see means I will get nothing much from the product whatsoever. This companies attempts to turn their overpriced device into a SaaS offering on the basis of poor content and poor health tracking is just disgusting. I will likely bin my Oura ring quite frankly and find something that can actually record and track physical excericse properly.

Customer service has been non existent and patronizing…,"Customer service has been patronizing UNHELPFUL writing me, what quickly became cut and paste rehash-responses. My issue has been that continually and often, I receive completely inaccurate readings sleep and readiness data. Maybe readiness is debatable, but saying reports that indicate I been awake 7 out of 8 hrs per night are ludicrous. Each time I’ve sent a pic to document this, CS ‘Jennifer’ offers the same ‘nothing we can do, but we are aware’ robotic response - loaded with all the correct sounding ‘concern’ phases, which are completely vapid and demonstrate a genuine lack of concern for actual service. Tiresome, annoying to say the least, leaving me with the only one choice - buy an another new ring! Or be satisfied with blatantly inaccurate data. I had loved my experience up to this point for the past 2.5 yrs. Now sadly, I’d highly recommend NOT buying their product.

I've had 2 rings for a few years,I've had 2 rings for a few years. My original I don't pay a monthly fee but I bought another one and apparently there is now a monthly fee. I've had a few issues with the rings but after many emails (no phone support) they did solve the issues. My big complaint is regarding the chargers. They just don't last. I did get a replacement originally but I have to buy new chargers now. This last one lasted 7 months. They don't last a year so expect to have to buy a new charger every 7-10 months which has been our experience. I've had 4 chargers up to this point and now have to order another one after a week of going back and forth complaining about the charger issues though email (no phone support) and getting turned down for a free replacement. Initially there wasn't any competition. There are now other rings on the market which I will be checking into and I would advise everyone to do your research on current ring options. Certainly not a fan of the monthly fee and the customer support is unbearable.,1,2023-09-24T10:21:29.000Z,John Kellmann,US,4.0

I felt this was unfair Marketting as of course I would have waited for the better product with some “coming soon”‘Marketting.., I emailed them and they said I couldn’t change to the new product. I therefore already started on the back foot, stuck with an old model for the same price. It’s now becoming more and more inaccurate, not picking up on naps or certain exercise. I was also pregnant for the best part of the last year and I emailed about the data as it constantly showed low readiness scores etc., that we’re not adjusting for the fact my numbers were higher (like resting heart rate) due to the pregnancy which is totally normal. When I contacted Oura about a year ago, the only option was also to buy a whole new ring, with the ongoing subscription. Oura do not seem to value or take care of their customers, and I will no longer be purchasing from this company despite loving the concept (which also looks like a scratched gold mess after about 6 months).",1,2023-09-19T01:33:28.000Z,Katherine Kimber,GB,1.0

"Many useful features, stunning quality, and excellent customer support helped to justify the cost.","Great for experimentation and seeing tangibly the results of changes to your daily routine, such as drinking less alcohol or reducing screen time, on your sleep, readiness score, etc. As a university student, I bought my ring whilst studying for very difficult exams - I was pushing myself on a daily basis, and a frequent problem I encountered was knowing when to take a break, or keep going. Checking my readiness score and quality of sleep daily helped inform me on making these decisions, ultimately helping me pass my exams without compromising my health/quality of life too much.I also found great use in the meditation recordings, another feature of the monthly subscription. Meditation/mindfulness is something I only started after buying the ring; it's now integrated itself fully into my daily routine, and I couldn't be more grateful. Whilst I wouldn't buy the ring purely for this feature, it does help justify the cost of the ring for me, along with everything else. (Though aside from the cost of the ring/monthly subscription, I did have to pay an additional 99 GBP for import duty/tax! UK buyers beware!!)Also a big fan of the notification features whereby Oura reminds you to stand up and stretch your legs when it (very accurately) detects you've been sedimentary for too long (in my case, sitting at my desk studying or in bed scrolling through Instagram); or when you're close to reaching your activity goal; or when it's approaching bedtime.I got the Rose Gold Horizon model, and it's been over a month now. The colour started off slightly yellow, but has since transitioned into a beautiful earthly rose. No chips yet, surface isbstill smooth and shiny. P.S: If you do strength training like me, make sure to take the ring off in the gym to avoid metal-to-metal contact, which is the fastest way to scratch the ring!As for the customer service, which seems to be terrible according to every other Trustpilot review, I personally encountered no issues whatsoever with Oura's support - on the contrary, they were very quick and efficient to reply to my questions/requests, taking as little as 5-10 minutes or a few hours at most. I am sorry to hear if others' experiences differed in the past, but if this is how the customer service is moving forward, then it's a sign that they've taken up the feedback in a positive way, and I'm happy to support a company that does this. Thank you to the team at Oura for your product and service!",5,2023-06-25T10:06:20.000Z,Michelle Sorocovici,GB,3.0

Oura Stealth Misadvertised.,"Be careful when choosing your colour.I've had an expensive lesson regarding this.I purchased the ""Matte Black"" Stealth ring which when it turned up is a silver grey.I wanted to return the ring for a black ring but because the black is cheaper Oura won't exchange the ring.

I also lost money (£11) on DHL charges for handling the additional VAT fee of £73 which I need to pay.I now need to jump through HMRC hoops in the hope to get the VAT charge refunded.Also lost money between purchase & refund on FX charges. I'm £120 down & no ring.I would still like the cheaper black ring but will need to pay ALL the charges again.Oura has eventually explained to me in an email why the stealth ring is not matte black & will eventually turn shiny black - might as well buy shiny black in the first place. This is all due to Oura's inability to give a complete description of the stealth ring.They are currently not answering my request to discount the new black ring or waive subscription charges until I'm not out of pocket.If only they would do the sensible thing & exchange rings across price ranges. 😕 This would save unnecessary fees being incurred.Oh!

My sisters and I bought the Oura Ring…,"My sisters and I bought the Oura Ring for our Mom for her 70th birthday. She didn't like it, and I tried using it for the 30-day trial period thereafter and reached the same conclusion.We both had the same reasons for finding the Oura Ring to be unhelpful and not worth the investment. First, the data it provides is not especially helpful, and not much more robust or actionable than what we already get with our Apple Watch. Oura's top line scores - Readiness, Sleep, and Activity - are not particularly helpful for varying reasons.First, sleep is inaccurate. I use a Dreem 2 headband, which provides sleep lap quality sleep data. The Oura Ring consistently and significantly undershot deep sleep and was also off - though less significantly - on REM sleep. The data it provided were not meaningfully different from or more accurate than Apple Watch sleep tracking data, which are generally accepted to be inaccurate. Readiness - it's a top line score that we didn't know what to do with. It didn't provide any surprising insights that were actionable. I know when I'm tired or when I'm feeling good, and don't need an expensive device to tell me to take it easy. It generally just tracked how I was feeling after a night of sleep.Activity - it doesn't provide anything more than a fitness tracker, and if you're interested in the Oura Ring, you probably already have a fitness tracker (and there are better ones out there). Finally, when I shared this with Oura and tried to return outside of the 30-day return period, they rejected my request for return.

"Never again, Oura","Their company is literally the worst - I used to love this product - their customer service has destroyed any shred of respect.I have purchased multiple rings (two as gifts).  Oura knew they were gifts (as we had sizing issues).  When my giftees tried to ask for customer support on the product, Oura would not help them as they were not purchased on their oura account.  Oura, why would I need four rings?  So basically three of the four purchased through my account do not have any access to customer support or upgrades.  Upgrades need to be done through my account - because the ring and purchase cannot transfer an email address.  That would have been GREAT to know BEFORE purchase but there is no mention of this anywhere and highly unusual as a standard.What's more is that now inputting my ""workouts' are not showing up in my activity score.  This impacts Activity and also Readiness and makes the platform useless for tracking and predicting these functions.  Today, my Activity told me I needed to hit it harder than normal because I had been inactive for several days - this is after manually entering in daily workouts where I work like a beast.  Today, after a 500 calorie burn (showing IN the activity panel), my burn meter is at 49.

I've come to learn how eating late influences my sleep, and now eat earlier. I've learned that exercise results in my body needing recovery time the next day. I've even seen the effect of alcohol and illness on my sleep. The daily analysis is spot on and the accuracy seems quite good.The ring is expensive and, yes, you have to pay for monthly service (both of which are obvious up front, so please let's not bang on these guys with bad reviews for what you darn well knew up front.)What isn't obvious is how useful this information and daily analysis is in improving your life. That awareness comes over time, day after day reviewing how your body is doing with rest and readiness. So well done, Oura. You should know that the finish of these rings is not particularly durable. They will scratch and no matter which one you purchase, within a month or so, you'll start to see the base silver metal gleaming from those scratches.  I'd read about this weakness and purchased the ""Stealth Black"" knowing that flat black just happens to be the color of Black Sharpies, which I use to neatly cover up scratches. So, again, read the reviews and know what you're getting: a better look at what is going on inside your body - providing you information you can use to improve yourself.It's not a perfect piece of jewelry, but it is a wonderful, insightful tool to a better life for you.",4,2023-04-20T18:58:07.000Z,Charles Welsh,US,3.0

Oura Ring - THINK TWICE!!!,"I purchased my Oura gen 3 ring back in August 2022 along with the extended warranty.  While initially I was very pleased with the insights into my overall health, there have been some developments which have made me change my mind about this product. First of all, all the data that the ring gives you is great, however, after the trial period you must purchase a membership to continue getting that data otherwise you only get the score without the insights, which essentially tells you nothing.  It’s the details that tell you what your body is doing so that you can make changes to your habits to better your health. At the price point of this product, comparable to an Apple Watch, Oura should provide those insights without having to buy a membership.Secondly, over the last 6 months I’ve lost weight to the point that the ring no longer fits and falls off my finger rendering it unwearable.  I reached out to Oura to see about exchanging the ring for a different size and because I had purchased the ring more than 30 days prior i was told I could not exchange it for a different size.  While I understand there has to be so limits, I believe 30 days is too short of a time. Other wearables typically have 90 to 365 days to return/exchange the product if something isn’t right.In conclusion, while I enjoy the data that the ring gives me, honestly, the Oura ring just isn’t worth the price, especially considering the limited ability to exchange/return the ring. Additionally having to purchase a membership (at $75/year) to actually unlock the data is ridiculous.  You should get all the metrics without having to pay for it monthly, especially with the $400 price tag.In short you should save your money, or just purchase a smartwatch that will give you just as many metrics and be able to do many other things as well.",1,2023-04-05T20:50:46.000Z,Chuck,US,2.0

By limiting the app features, you are essentially penalizing those who have chosen not to become members.As someone who values the data and insights provided by your app, I feel that this change significantly diminishes the value of your product. It also undermines the trust that I have placed in your brand and the belief that you are committed to providing the best possible experience for your customers.I urge you to reconsider your decision and restore the full functionality of your app to all users, regardless of membership status.

But demanding 300-350 dollars for the ring and then the membership for 6.99 dollar a month is a robbery.Re do and do it right.",1,2023-03-26T13:45:58.000Z,Emil,SE,5.0

Most day's I think the data does align with how I sleep which I do find interesting and motivating to prioritise sleep as when you have hard number's showing you have slept it's salient. The ring is a little pricey and don't think you should have to pay for the membership, I also had to pay more because of import fees which were not made clear at the time of purchase. Nevertheless still glad I bought the product.",4,2023-03-25T18:51:25.000Z,Alan,GB,1.0
Holds your own data ransom,"I got an Oura mainly to hopefully use it as a period tracker. I was aware that it was on beta and was hopeful it would improve as I continued to own and use it. The data for sleeping and general readiness was nice to see as well and honestly I didn't care if it was 100% accurate 24/7 or not but the temperature and heart rate was what I cared about along with period tracking/predicting. I started to rely on the ring as the features improved and I could start using it for ovulation tracking based on temperature,BUT THEN THE MEMBERSHIP RAN OUT. And guess what? That entire feature, and all of the charts and data for the other categories other than the general score numbers, were gone and locked behind a paywall. MY OWN DATA. Held ransom. With the membership there was like four sections of screen to swipe between. And with that gone, now only two. But guess what stayed? The stupid meditation videos and sleep music, which is now one of the two screens. You know. The stuff that should have been the membership. Trying to navigate fertility in the blind now is a major life upset as I had just begun to get the confidence to use the temperature and cervical mucus methods which are in line with my religion, but no! Money and greed is the name of Oura's game. Again. I already paid all that money for this product, which should have all the data and charts as BASE info. The video and music stuff? THAT should have been the membership. They could have made the membership be a competition between friends to have the best scores or something else ""extra"". Put the ""based on your sleep last night you should rest today!"" ""What chronotype are you?"" stuff behind the paywall. Imagine if one of those exercise watches that counts your steps and calories and heart rate etc cut off everything but step count. NO, worse than that. Imagine if it took all that data, did some behind the scenes math and gave you a vague number score for how you did today. ""So how many steps did I do, how's my calorie burn?"" You ask. ""Oh we know, but here's an arbitrary number, subscribe for the actual data you produced yourself and we now hold hostage! Thanks for that, sucker!""Honestly screw Oura and I will never suggest it to anyone else. If I could have my way I'd want the same thing the old Gen people get, the lifetime membership, because DUH. That's what the BASIC plan should be. The ring is useful and non invasive in my life, the whole point of buying it. I don't want to return it or get rid of it because I know just how much I liked it. But now it is a useless piece of tech waste. There is no way I'm paying a subscription to see my own data. Where is the morals? This is health data we are talking about. There are stories about people finding out they had heart problems or caught that they had covid early with this thing but they had to have had the membership because there is no charts to show you that data otherwise. It's just plain predatory what Oura is doing.",1,2023-03-24T04:25:02.000Z,No,US,1.0
Buyer Beware,"Save your Money!#1 The battery life is atrocious. The first 6 months the battery charge lasted about 6-7 days.  After 6 months, it doesn't even last a day before alerting you that it needs to charge. I can literally charge first thing in the morning and by the evening it will tell me to charge before going to bed. #2 Worthless without the membership.  I find it absurd to pay nearly $350 for a product that then requires a $6.39/monthly expense just to see the information it is ""supposedly"" gathering. #3 This leads me to my third point.  The data it does gather is extremely inaccurate, which is why it led me to discontinue paying for a membership.  It would tell me that I had slept so many hours when in fact I was up and about cleaning the house yet it was recording me as sleeping.  It would also not accurately account for REM sleep, when in fact I know I was in REM sleep because I woke up recalling my dreams in vivid detail yet the ring would say I was awake.  It rarely accurately analyzed my actual time in bed sleeping patterns. Also would not accurately account for workout time periods.Save your money!  Oura hasn't figured out the technology piece yet.

Pretty ring but very uncomfortable with basic software,"The packaging is gorgeous. They ship the trial rings and product swiftly. However, :1. The ring, despite being sized well woke me up with nerve pain shooting down my middle finger one night 2. The ring is bulky and in my experience  gets in the way of doing things with either of my hands. It hits rings on adjacent fingers so I have had to take them off. So much so that this reason alone I would not recommend the ring. 3. The ring constantly rotates so I’m having to check whether the sensor is on the bottom constantly. 4. The sleep and heart rate functions are no better and seem worse than my Apple Watch. I thought because the ring is on a finger it would be better5. When inputting exercise options it doesn’t have Barrecore. In summary, it’s uncomfortable constantly during the day and cramps the fingers at night as they swell and the ring is so thick. The software isn’t that great. I spent about £700 after Uk duties and  kicking myself for not get in g another Apple Watch.

I will not be purchasing another Oura ring.,"I purchased a new Oura Ring at the end of 2021 and started using it in early 2022. I loved my ring and the information it gave me on my sleep, movement, and readiness. I loved the sleekness of the ring and how wearable it was without feeling bulky or uncomfortable. Sadly, in less than a year of use, the ring's battery life started to dwindle. At about a year of use, it wouldn't last more than 24 hours on a charge which isn't useful for hiking trips. The Oura ring is expensive as a fitness tracker and charges a monthly subscription to gain access to all of the info it is gathering. The readiness score often did not translate to how I felt physically and hitting my snooze button upon waking would affect my number more than it should, in my opinion. I wouldn't mind the cost or even the monthly charge if it didn't crap out so quickly. I will not be purchasing another Oura ring.",2,2023-02-18T18:02:01.000Z,Tricia Bowen Balonier,US,1.0

I know at least 6 people in the same situation (no money back, no ring). Do not recommend the company.

So far a 4-star,"So far a 4-star. I did have a glitch in the ordering after I got my sizing kit, which I did get very quickly. But there was a problem on the ordering screen and I could not confirm my ring size. After a bit of frustration I did contact Support which I (think) was via email but I’m not sure.  it was late in the evening and I got an immediate reply saying yes they were having problems with their ordering system but she took my ring size and manually entered it in their system. The order went through quickly and I had my ring within a week. I have only had the ring three days but I will post my initial experience and update later as needed. I got the GEN 3 base model (no special color) silver ring. I recorded one work out but afterwards the app told me it didn’t record any heart rate monitoring during the work out. I was on a Nordic track skier machine, so yes I was gripping a plastic handle in my hand. - very disappointing since my Nordic track is my go to bad weather work out. And not getting a heart rate for an entire work out kind of defeats the purpose. I also get some gaps during the day where I have no heart rate measured so I am suspecting if I sized too big? But when I had the sizing kit I really questioned the next size smaller, thinking it was cutting off circulation or when my finger swells during long hikes I was afraid it would be too small.Anyway the sleep data for now seems OK. I do have a lot of questions as to how it knows when I’m in bed versus just chilling in the evening watching TV on the couch, but it has been accurate for the first two nights so far. I am disappointed to see all of the one and two star reviews here, I did not read them before my purchase. But I am keeping an open mind at this point.",4,2023-01-14T19:28:57.000Z,"Paige, USA",US,3.0
Just not what I expected,"This ring gives a lot of data, LIKE A LOT A LOT but if your score is low in a particular category, there’s no advice on how to better it. In my opinion, if you’re pulling an extreme amount of data, you should be able to tell me how to tweak certain aspects to achieve favorable scores. I believe this is something that may come in time, but they’re definitely lacking currently. Also, if you order the wrong size, DO NOT process it as an exchange. Go ahead and full on return the product as a refund and out right buy another. Their policy is one exchange OR refund. So if you exchange your ring for a size issue, you WILL NOT be able to return the ring if you find out later you do not like it.",2,2023-01-12T00:25:54.000Z,Chan,US,1.0

Oura is a 5-star product,"Oura is a 5-star product. I am not a person who writes reviews, but I'm reviewing this now in case it helps even one person balance the negative reviews on trust pilot. It seems that people only come to trust pilot when they have a complaint, so you only see the negative. This week I was planning to buy an ebike. I checked out the ebike reviews on trust pilot, and it almost made me give up. Then to calibrate, I checked out the reviews for eightsleep and for oura. Two products I really love. Both are two stars? LoL! No way!I don't like buying an unproven gadget from a small company. Did it work? Is it reliable? Will the company even be around to honor the warranty? Unfortunately, it is not on amazon, so it's hard to get reliable reviews. I'm glad I took the plunge with oura. I've had it for two years, and I'm on my second ring, I gave my first one to my dad and he also loves it. Their web site and software and customer service are all great. The ring maybe had some quirks in the beginning, but it has been so long I don't even remember, and now it is part of my everyday habit so it is hard give a fresh perspective.A few things...I wish it could track HRV all the time, but I guess you can only really get that from a chest strap monitor. It is great for sleep, though! I wish it had more guided meditation features.  I'm very surprised at how sturdy it is. I don't recommend treating it like I do (once you wear it all the time it is hard to remember that you have a pretty complex gadget on your finger), but so far it has held up to everything.Best of luck with the product.

After firmware update to ring...battery…,"Update: 12/26: tried recharging ring one final time before discarding. Ring now seems to hold a charge longer than a few hours. Still a disappointing decline, but it seems that perhaps some issue on Oura side may have at least been adjusted. No transparency or alerts shared by Oura - but felt worth mentioning that ring quasi-usable. Original post 10/20/2022: After firmware update to oura ring...battery life went from a couple days to not holding a charge. Out of warranty period shouldn't mean open-season on older models - functionally ""killing"" the product with updates that render the unit useless. My frustration stems from Oura's handling of situation - which feels like it has all the ingredients of a class action lawsuit. Oura recognized and acknowledged their battery issues with product...yet did not notify users that updates may render their ring useless. Why not just invite customers to throw their ring away instead of wasting time & effort of rediscovering this known condition - then try to solve - with no Oura remedy - nor an opportunity to restore former settings that make product usable? Instead - they offer you a ""gracious"" opportunity to hand them another $400 - minus a $75 customer discount. This product defect - and their handling of the issue - do not feel like a relationship worth continuing - if their business model includes rendering models over 2 years old functionally obsolete - with incompatible updates.

This weekend I got shocked when noticing that in one night the ring had become an useless pretty paper weight and actually it doesn’t do even that so well being so light…To be honest this is quite polite way to say how expensive this crap is. Let’s put this other way, if you want ring buy a golden one it keeps the value. If you want to follow health, sleep and other things that Oura advertised buy iWatch, Garmin, Polar, five cheap activity meters, stethoscope+phone+Pile of paper or anything else that will do the thing.

Oura Ring - Don't Buy it!,"I was a true advocate of the Oura ring after purchasing the Generation 2 ring, then the Generation 3. I had even recommended it to at least 200 of my executive clients. However, my opinion of the product and company has rapidly gone downhill - the customer service is also horrendous. After purchasing the Generation 3 ring and knowing that you would have to pay for a membership, which I didn't want to do (after the so-called 'free' membership expired) Oura's marketing led me (and vast amounts of others) that you would only 'lose' the new statistical analysis which came into play with the Generation 3 ring. What a shameful marketing ploy - not only did you lose the new analysis but everything that existed previously. You only have three screens which are completely useless without the background information. Tom Hale, the CEO of Oura needs to be totally ashamed of what Oura has done and how he has let his customers down. I am taking this further on a legal basis and with the Trading Standards governmental departments both in Finland and California. The customers who were not told the truth either need a full reinstatement of the analysis or a full refund.",1,2022-11-04T16:49:09.000Z,Iain,GB,18.0
Works for me so far.,I put off buying one of these because of the poor reviews. But I visited a friend last summer and she spoke highly of Oura so I took the plunge.It was sorted quickly and I've been happy with customer support. There are a few issues with the ring but I've had an excellent response so far so thought it important that I post my positive review.,5,2022-10-26T16:58:01.000Z,Geoff W,GB,12.0
I could not live without my Oura ring,"Finally, I did receive my Oura ring and it is an amazing device. Of all the devices I have owned -and still do- over the past 20 years, it is by far the best.I have used it for more than a year now and it is part of my everyday, more than my smartwatch. It has helped me improved my health in general, not only with keeping me active but also sleeping better,and having better habits.One of the reason it surpasses my other devices is that the Oura ring battery lasts several days and if I put it on its charger for 5 or 10 minutes here and there, I actually never have to worry about it dying.  Because of that, I have been able to keep a perfect track of my sleep and my activities in a surprisingly constant manner, no glitch..Sleep: It analyzes my sleep perfectly, keeping track not only of its length but also of its pattern and quality, as well as measuring my heart rate, my body temperature, my oxygen level (and based on these data, I was able to suspect that I had Covid-19, took a test which confirmed it).The readiness and activity components are also excellent, helping me in every aspect of my life.Finally, the app is updated regularly, making it better and better as time passes.",5,2022-10-25T18:31:07.000Z,Rosine Sauvage,US,4.0
Appalling company. Avoid.,"Ring is fine, works well and syncs with app well. But the shocker is the TOTAL lack of transparency when buying, if you’re a UK resident, about import charges. Worse, Oura completely ignore approaches and complaints about this. Plus they turn the app into a subscription-based model. Whilst I like my ring, as find it useful, it’ll be going on eBay once that subscription is up. Avoid",1,2022-10-23T14:47:52.000Z,Schmoogle,GB,1.0

The ring is inaccurate and no support,"The ring is inaccurate. I have tried the ring since the beginning of the year and it is completely inaccurate. I have compared results with medical grade test devices to come to this conclusion. I have attempted to get answers from Oura support and they never answer my questions. They just ignore the the questions. Most recently after asking why the steps were different than my other steps tracking devices and they said it’s because Oura is more sensitive. So I said “Then why Oura always record less steps even though I wear it 24 hours a day?” They had no answer. The sleep tracking works intermittently and when it does actually record my sleep, it’s wrong. I had a medical sleep test for apnea and compared the results to Oura. Completely different. I asked my cardiologist about the Oura results because I wanted to know the significance of some of the measurements and he said “Some of the items Oura tracks are pretty meaningless from the standpoint of understanding what’s going on with your heart”. Oura support has still not answered my questions. I also lost a ring. Someone found it and returned it to OURA. OURA said they shipped it back to me and I should check the tracking number. Sadly they didn’t provide one and all my attempts to get them to answer me since I requested the tracking number have been ignored.This is evidently a foreign company. They take up to four weeks to respond and then you get no help. You can’t speak to a person and get real answers. They don’t have any. I would like to know where they are located so I can have my attorney serve them for non performance. I started asking for my money back a few months ago but got no answer.

Extreme buyer remorse,"100% agree with other reviewers who bought the Gen 3 ring, and once the recurring monthly subscription fee kicked in the ring becomes completely useless. I wish I would have researched other options that offer this type of data for free after you spend significant money buying the device. For example, my Apple Watch keeps updating and offering new features over time with no additional fees. My ZiPP facial device is the same. OURA is a rip-off and practically a scam in my opinion.

Membership fee is a major curveball,"I received it as a birthday present early January. I was super happy with the product and I have also spoken positively about it to friends and family. However, their way of introducing their new membership fee is so amateur. I don't recall any information through the app on this and now they brand themselves as the membership being their product which isn't fair to early adopters. If it wasn't because the ring was so expensive it would have been fine, but even then the value the ring provides me doesn't nearly come close to other membership apps (Eg. Calm). It was a good product while being free but I do NOT recommend buying this now unless you're a pro-athlete, scholar, or financially well off enough. The accuracy of the ring and the information isn't adequate enough for them to charge a membership fee in my opinion but to each their own.",1,2022-10-07T15:35:31.000Z,Christoffer,DK,4.0
I´m disappointed to the Gen3 ring,"I´m disappointed to the Gen3 ring, as many others I was also mislead that with the basic functions I would get data of the three main categories. The reality shows that I get ONE figure per each area - that´s all. Additionally I received every Monday a notification that I have a weekly report available...as I couldn´t find the report I contacted their support and the answer was that ""it is a bug, I shouldn´t see it as I didn´t pay the monthly fee"" and an advice to update the ring as the version is old. Nope, I´m not going to update it and I´m not going to charge it anymore either as I don´t want somebody to benefit of the data which I cannot even see myself. Additionally I found the ""raw data"" on the web, so actually I can see that the numbers are there but really hard to read in the format they are presented. There might be a good opportunity for some software developer to generate a program where you can drop the CSV or JSON files and get a graphical view.

"Defective ring, terrible customer service.",I got this as a gift and it stopped charging. They also noticed that the charger was not functioning properly and stated they would replace the ring. They asked me all these questions and I answered them all and after about 12 emails back-and-forth they said they couldn't find me in the system and I said that's not my problem the problem is with this ring. I had to give them my daughters information they said that's fine as long as they had her name and that didn't turn up anything. And I said it's absolutely irrelevant it was given to me as a gift the ring is not charging what do you want to do about it?They told me to give them all this information and at the end of the 12 emails back-and-forth they dumped me. They didn't want to discuss it they did not want any more information and you can tell by the documentation because they said they it was not charging from their end. willing to replace it. After this review I will take it to the Better Business Bureau. The issue is the fact that the ring is not charging properly is probably a manufacturing issue which is fine it happens to the best of us unfortunately it happened to me and I wanted them to replace the ring it's that simple it didn't have to be brand new it could've been one of the older models I didn't really care but I wished it would charge properly now it's just a circular device that matches my watchband it's absolutely useless and I feel terrible for my daughter because it doesn't work.I would recommend in all honesty to stay away from this particular ring. Because their customer service is absolutely terrible.

Well Oura you lost my business and my spouse's, pretty sure others will drop this as well, I think the product is great, not only for the info you get while wearing it, sleeping with it, exercising with it, etc. But the design is actually kind of classy.   I am so disappointed that your company's not interested in keeping those existing customers happy and allowing them the continued use of a great tool,  but instead more focused on software and squeezing out some extra dollars for those same customers for what should be free when we pay $400-500 for the thing.

Great priduct with suspect battery and customer support,"Bought a Gen 3 Stealth in March so still in free trial period and warranty. Love the ring functionality and the look and it has worked very well for sleep and activity tracking.  Out of nowhere a few weeks ago ring had major battery drain issues (less than a day per charge) and wouldn’t charge past 60 pct regardless of how long on charger.  First 4 emails from the website went unanswered despite saying 24 hour response time.  Opened a new ticket in the app and got a response in 48 hours and immediate replacement which has worked so far but not an inspiring start.  Also, think the warranty may be shortened to one year on Gen 3 and doesn’t not restart with a replacement due to defect so may happen again without ability to replace.  Hope they get it sorted out between hardware and software.",2,2022-09-02T15:22:46.000Z,Chris Temple,US,1.0
"Shocking customer service, performance and battery issues","I have been an Oura user for two years. I purchased my second Oura ring, Gen 3, in November 2021. I've had multiple performance issues with it, including battery, syncing, and inaccurate and nonsensical readings. I have tried to contact customer service many times. Eventually, when I managed to get to them, they obfuscated and were very unhelpful. Whilst eventually they accpeted that the ring is faulty, they have not done anythign to replace it.

Don't purchase the Oura Ring,"I purchased the Oura Ring Gen 3 in March 2022. I can't remember the last time I regretted a purchase like this and it comes fully down to the after service. The ring worked perfectly for the first 4 months or so but as soon as the new blood oxygen reading software update was launched suddenly I started having a ton of problems with it. It couldn't keep a charge, the sleep monitoring accuracy cratered and the charger itself burned hot when it was plugged in. It also blinked white repeatedly regardless of whether the ring was on it or not. I've been chatting back and forth with their after service for almost 2 months now and they are completely useless. After each response I need to raise a new ticket and when I do get responses, they are mostly offering basic troubleshooting advice. They've eventually admitted it is due to the update and their ""engineers are working on the problem"" so in the meantime, I'm stuck holding onto a 500 dollar piece of plastic that I can't return.

"Useful data, but no battery life","For a while I was very pleased with my ring, I find it more convenient than a bracelet and it gives more detailed and useful data about sleep, which is my main concern/interest rather than exercise. However recently battery life has gone down to a few hours and if it goes low during the night or early morning, the ring doesn’t register any data for the entire night. Sometimes what it considers “too low” to be able to record data is just anything below 70%. This means the ring is now useless. For something that expensive (270 euros) I would have expected a much longer life span.  I have contacted Ourarings customer service, but they didn’t reply.",2,2022-08-28T16:50:05.000Z,Luna B,DK,33.0

The ring has been the BIGGEST DISAPOINTMENT for a device that is intended to gather health data IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. I have had several versions of the Apple watch, Fitbit, and Garmin Vivoactive devices. Fitbit and Garmin did not disappoint, but were not as integrated to Apple as I would have preferred.  The problem with the OURA is that they do not provide displays of the raw and unfiltered data, instead they compress the hell out of it into a sort of dashboard that only contains ""idiot lights"" that might tell you something if you are already dead.

Not worth it: Terrible customer service and questionable material quality.,"Genuinely the worst customer service and then add on the poor quality of the ring materials. Ring quality: I've had my ring just about 6 months. I chose to get the gold one. I started noticing quickly that the ring scratches easily. Then by month 4-5 I started noticing the color didn't look that gold anymore. The ring color has rubbed off substantially all over the edges to silver. I take my ring off to wash my hands or shower and don't wear it to lift weights because it'll scratch. It's still covered in scratches and the color is worn off. For a $400+taxes ring, this is ridiculous. Customer service: Literally took forever to respond. They then closed my case altogether and I had to reopen it through different channels to finally get a response. Now, they've asked me to return my ring so that they can examine it and then send me a replacement. Hmmm, no. That's a terrible policy. Most companies would see the defective coating on it and say okay, send a replacement, and then ask me to send my original one back in the packaging. Considering how slow the service is at Oura, I'm only guessing that I would end up without my ring for who knows how long. I'd rather just get a refund and go buy another vendor at that point. I asked them to send me a replacement and then I'll return this one. Their response was no that isn't their policy... I have been going back and forth with this company for over 2 weeks because it takes them ages to respond and then their responses are not useful or solution oriented.

Only 14 months of lifetime - bad deal...,"My Oura ring 2 only worked properly for about 14 months. When I bought my ring, I actually had it sitting on my desk for a year before I started using it. When I finally got around to registering and using it, I was quite happy with it.  However......after a year or so, I noticed that the battery life was changing. It would have around 40% battery left going to bed, only to find the ring ""dead"" the next morning (leaving me without tracking). It was annoying but did not make much of it. I started charging the ring more often, now every 2 days. Then a friend told me that the ring may have a known battery issue and I should contact support. I did. And yes, they did in fact confirm that my ring had the known battery issue. However, since my battery issues started 2 months after the guarantee period finished, I was out of luck. They offered me a $75 discount on a new ring (which comes with a monthly subscription, nonetheless). Now, what frustrates me, is that I only used the ring for 14 months until my issues started. Had I used the ring from the day it arrived at my house, I guess I could be more understanding. But in my case, the ring only functioned properly for 14 months. At $315, I am expecting a longer lifetime. The thing is, you need to register the ring and get an account to use the ring. Therefore it is very easy for Oura to see that the ring starts failing after only 14 months, despite I physically had it for 2+ years. That's the thing with data. They are trackable...I cannot recommend a $315 product that has a lifetime of barely a year. Get yourself an Apple Watch or Fitbit or anything else.

Especially after a terrible experience a year ago where I lost an oura charger and oura refused to replace it for a jaw dropping $120usd with import costs, almost 50% of the cost a new ring, just for the charger! Not a penny of a discount for a returning customer.Now they are under new management and treating customers much better. When my Oura 2 battery died, despite it being out of warranty they rushed over a new ring from the UK to Mexico absolutely free of charge.I heard the company is under new management and they are doing a great job keeping old customers happy rather then the former CEO that thought they could treat their customers like dirt.I'm still annoyed about the fact that Oura 3 charges people a high price for the ring AND a monthly subscription rather then either one or the other (Example Garmin tracking is free but device is premium cost and, whoop is free but you pay monthly to use it, but Oura 3 charges both high price AND monthly fee!)Either way they are moving in the right direction and i wanted to thank Oura again for shipping me a replacement.",5,2022-05-07T17:56:44.000Z,Freddy Lansky,DE,4.0

When I finally got a response it would take another month to get a reply.  Absolutely zero focus on the customer. What used to be fast, helpful customer centred service is now non-existent.

Seemed a promising concept but has…,"Seemed a promising concept but has tended to perform fairly poorly. A fairly small set of sizes means it can be tricky to get a good fit. Potentially useful HRV measured overnight but seemingly uses RMSSD as opposed to SDNN which seems more common. Sleep tracking is hit and miss - mostly seems to be reasonably accurate but occasionally has an off day (or night). A few times it doesn't seem to pick up the end of sleeping, even though I have been logging activities. Easy to log workouts after the event but the automatic workout tracking is pretty poor and doesn't seem to detect much other than walking (apart from when it decided I was strength training at 4am whilst actually sleeping). Worst part is of late the iOS app constantly completely crashes on opening meaning I often have to remove the app, reinstall and then reconnect the app. For UK customers be aware that tax isn't included in the purchase price so you'll be charged VAT by the courier on top of what you've already paid.

How a company lost their ethics and morals while growing - The Oura Story,"Oura ring passionate user since 2018 (Generation 2). Then, Generation 3 was announced and with it Oura decided to strip functionalities and capabilities that had always been available with the purchase of a Generation 2 Oura ring, unless I bought a new Generation 3 ring and with it I would get ""lifetime access"" to the new premium purchase. So basically, they extorted old users for their money in order to be able to continue using what they were promised when they purchased their previous ring. Appalling, to say the least.Begrudingly, I purchased Generation 3 to do exactly what I did with Generation 2. New features not only not interest me but the vast majority of them is NOT available yet. One day, Oura promise, they will be. We don't know when, but they must keep their promises, right?From a passionate user of almost three years until Gen 3 came about, I would now never buy a new Oura ring, nor would I recommend them to anybody.Oura is a company that lost their ethics and morals while growing up.

not accurate. not worth it.,"I’ve had a Gen2 for over a year now. Initially I loved it and thought its information seemed to be mostly accurate but that is absolutely not the case as of late. For the last few months, 6/7 nights it consistently says I’m awake off and on between the hours of 10pm and 12am, sometimes indicating I was awake for up to an hour at a time. This is completely untrue. I go to bed between 8 and 9 most nights and those first few hours are when I know I sleep the hardest. My bf comes to bed later, and he’s not quiet getting ready for bed but I hear nothing and stir none in my sleep. I’m out. And then there are many times where the ring doesn’t register when I actually do wake up. My cat likes to start waking me anytime between 3 and 5am and I’m constantly waking up to hush him or kick him out of the room. Yet during this period, my ring thinks I’ve been sound asleep. My body temp also always runs hot at night, always has, so my ring always thinks I’m either sick or unrecovered from yesterdays activities. It’s all pretty frustrating because it always messes with my readiness score and I’m always told to take it easy, even though I feel well rested and energetic enough to take on my usual activities. For these reasons, I don’t feel like it’s worth the hype or the cost. Just too many inaccuracies.",2,2022-04-17T18:07:45.000Z,B Carter,US,1.0
"A lot of hype, little action","Like many others, I was intrigued by the Oura ring. Alas the company itself is appalling. I ordered an Oura ring around 6 weeks ago and received the ring sizing kit a week later. I placed my order and was notified by DHL that I needed to pay an additional import fee of over £50. Oura lists on their website there are delivery charges but it fails to say that it’s >£50. The ring arrived and it was too small. I emailed Oura to arrange an exchange. This was painful, they take over a day to reply to each email so it was incredibly slow. Once they finally organised for DHL to collect the ring, DHL were a no show. I waited in for an entire day and no word from DHL. I emailed Oura and had no response. I emailed Oura again and they informed me to just deal with DHL. Really bad customer service, a company that is simply lazy about the customer experience.

Fantastic Oura Ring #2. Strongly recommend it!,I received my oura 2 ring in June or July of 2019. It is excellent & the customer service was great. The battery died after a few months & Oura replaced the ring in a nanosecond for absolutely no charge. I believe there's something fishy about all the negative reviews because the Oura ring has been most helpful for me in many ways most importantly helping me with my sleep disorder. The ring has enabled me to add hours to my nightly sleep. I strongly recommend the OURA RING (2nd generation is the one I have) to anyone interested in tracking their fitness & sleep.

The discount offered offset the UK customs charge (cheers Brexit), contrary to other reviews we were not asked to send our rings back and I kept my Gen 2 as a back up in case I lose or break my Gen 3. As an upgrading user I was offered free app usage for life, which I am really happy about. Shipping for both Gen 2 and Gen 3 was fast, I got the sizing kit in less than a week then the same with the ring, less than a week from size confirmation to receiving it. And while my Gen 3 holds charge a shorter time than my Gen 2, I assume thats because it does more stuff. I still only charge every 3 days, compared to an Apple Watch which needs to sit on its charger ALL night EVERY night.Oura has changed my behaviour for the better, I rest more, I take sleep more seriously and I get early signs if I am getting sick allowing me to focus on eating better and maybe cancelling some work outs.SO surprised at the reviews on here, I have a number of friends who have an Oura and none of us have had any of these issues.",5,2022-03-24T16:39:42.000Z,Ruth,GB,6.0

Love the ring but No response for 4 months?! They have my money & my ring. APPAULING,"One star because I was happy with my gen 2 ring - I don't wear jewellery because it drives me nuts but it was lightweight and comfortable. However, I only had it for a month before I was asked to send it back on the 18th November 2021. It's March 23 2022. I have no ring (which I bought to track circadian rhythms - a vital component of my bipolar management strategy). I’m an extremely understanding person having worked in sales and customer service for decades, but I haven't had a response to a single email since November 19th when I responded to the 'swap your gen 2 ring for a gen 3' email. They have my ring and my $450AUD (alot for me) and they can't even respond to an email ... I've sent 10-15. An email was sent from oura on the 7th Feb suggesting they'd been inundated by interest and were training new support staff but still not a single email has been responded to. EPIC FAIL OURA RING. I have NEVER experienced such low integrity and poor quality customer service. I can't even think about the money or the ring or the wasted time and energy it makes me want to be sick. Just such poor poor business practice.ADDITION AFTER LEAVING COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA >>I was happy to receive a PM from the OURA social media team after I left the above paragraph as a comment on a few posts. They managed to get a support person to email me, I felt a glimmer of hope. The staff member shared the step I’d missed in the process of getting my replacement ring sent to me (inputting my ring size). This was super helpful and I was grateful … even though it took 6 months to get the information. However, I’d sent 4 emails in 2022 to notify OURA that I was moving interstate so I could give a new postage address and stop paying the $30 a month mail redirection fee (which I set up just for the ring when I heard nothing from OURA between November and when I moved in Feb 10). When I went online and put my ring size in, the site confirmed my selection but there was nothing about confirming shipping address. I immediately looked in all the ‘my profile’ options and saw nowhere to change my address. I sent an email to the staff member who helped me to see if the address could be changed before postage. I then searched the FAQs on how to change my address. I logged in via the mobile app and the web address, nowhere could I change a postage address. Which I can understand given that normally it’s a one off product purchase and if they’re way busier than expected but OURA asked everyone with gen 2 rings to send them back in exchange for a gen 3. To me it makes sense to confirm people’s postage address in case it had changed since they bought their original ring. Before I heard back from anyone, 12 hours after I selected my ring size, I received an automated email telling me that my ring had been shipped - to the address I no longer live at. Sigh. I immediately responded to this email aswell. When I heard back from the original staff member I’d been emailing with, the response I got was incomplete and left me wondering AGAIN if my email had been read properly. “My apologies for missing your address change request.

My second heart rate monitor used during workout for comparison (pulse belt from Polar) records between 70 - 160 hbpm --> Oura stays between my resting pulse high 30'ties to 55.The ring seems (? can i trust that when workouts are not recognized) to capture non-active periods of the day, but rest is off.I've tried to reach out to customer service several times - only response I've gotten was basically ""you've had the product for more than 30 days and as of there's nothing we (Oura) can do"".I've tried to send 3 emails over the course of the last 30 days, each email is responded to with a generic ""we're busy and will get back in 7 days"". Nothing heard.Right now, no chance I would consider continuing the subscription service after the first 6 months free. I would actually expect a refund as the workout feature does not seem to work.Hope it helps to reach out for help here - again, the key target is to get the product to work, I truly hope my first unit was just an odd one out.",1,2022-03-15T00:46:29.000Z,Rasmus Barfred,DK,3.0

As I can see I'm not the only one who…,As I can see I'm not the only one who cannot stand this ring I have been asking them for weeks for help and all I get are automated messages telling me they don't offer phone support I don't want an automated message every 2 or 3 days that absolutely doesn't resolve my problem! I am impatiently awaiting them telling me how I can send this back and get my money back because it is not even close to what they said it was. I implore you to read the reviews on this ring before you spend the money on it cuz I would not recommend it. As for customer service there is none. You don't release some kind of product and then have absolutely no support for it. I have Googled nine ways to Sunday on how to figure it out myself and no matter what I do it doesn't work and I supposedly have the new generation and it certainly isn't getting to know me!

OURA rings are a NIGHTMARE!,"I received my Oura ring August 2020. I was impressed with my sleeping info but my day info was not accurate so I only wore it at night. I wore it for about three months then misplaced my ring in my bedroom. Once I  found and charged my ring, I couldn't get the ring to work. I bought a new phone thinking my phone wouldn't take the constant updates that Oura sent and I got the ring to work, never 100% though.I then began wearing it only while sleeping again and had an interesting experience, several actually. I guess Oura didn't appreciate my many texts complaining about my ring not working and requesting my money back. Before I  bought the ring I was told there was a one year guarantee. After the ring not working and asking for my money back through emails every week for months, I  started having night TERRORS when wearing my ring! I mean really bad, bad nightmares. My lifestyle or food that I ate had not changed, don't do drugs or alcohol. Then it came to me......Oura was connected to ME through my ring .....why did I think my ring was only being used by an app? As soon as I stopped wearing my Oura ring, my nightmares  stopped completely.  I truly believe that Oura was transmitting 'something' through the ring that affected me!!! I know that Apple watches are used to send vibrations to wake up people who have PTSD that are beginning to have a nightmare b/c I was screened for the study that has been currently approved by the FDA for Veterans. If that company could monitor and send info to the wearer then Oura certainly has the same technology. I still have not gotten a response from the FINLAND based company about an address to send my ring back. And, there is no phone number to which you can call and talk to an actual person, very clever.I would never recommend Oura to anyone; there is ZERO customer service once they get your money. And my nightmare experience, well, I will never ever trust another piece of technology jewelry on my body.",1,2022-03-08T22:33:00.000Z,Jo W.,US,7.0
Really poor customer service and inaccurate product,"Shocking customer service. After 2 months of trying and relentlessly following up I finally managed to arrange for a return of the product; initially I wanted to exchange the ring for a smaller size, but after my experience with customer service I decided to return the product altogether as had no confidence in them. effectively dealing with any future queries. Having sent the ring back it took another 4 weeks (and me following up a few times) for the money to arrive back with me.I truly understand and appreciate that high-growth businesses sometimes face ’growing pains’ and can't keep up with demand, but this does not appear to be a new 'issue' Oura are dealing with... Perhaps it's time to re-invest some of the revenue into a proper customer service team that can handle the volume of enquiries coming through.I also didn't think the ring was all that amazing either, having trialed it for three weeks. Apparently I slept like a baby every night during that time, which I certainly did not feel that way and it astonished me as to how that can be. I was very excited about this product but am leaning towards it being just a wellbeing gimmick.",1,2022-06-19T16:37:53.000Z,nalalee,GB,9.0

Worst experience,Oura ring needs investigating! I have never experienced customer service like this in all my life. In fact I would not even call it customer service. The service is non existent. Their motto of caring for people and health is simply meaningless. My extreme annoyance on Oura Ring’s respect towards their customers is beyond anything I thought was possible especially by a company who has become global. It’s as if pirates are working behind the scene! Something does not make sense. Something does not add up. Everyday a new celebrity face advert appears .. so they clearly have surplus funds BUT they have 0 courtesy to respond to client emails. I have been waiting for my ring for over 4 weeks. The day after I placed my order I changed my mind about the colour; from gold to silver. I have sent numerous emails and only one was replied to which did not respond to ANYTHING I asked. They have not refunded me the price difference between gold and silver. I have not received any confirmation email. I honestly cannot believe the level of disrespect and customer neglect. They charge an extortionate amount for the ring plus shipping etc. you then have to in In my case over 70 pounds duty to have it delivered. It’s so bizarre! Oura ring claims so much but delivers nothing! I haven’t even received my ring nearly 1 month on and I’ve had zero correspondence. I am disgusted! My mental capacity has gone down the drain. They do not care for their clients health. I’m extremely upset. I cannot believe I’ve had to even write this! As I said this company should be looked into by figures higher up as something does not make sense!,1,2022-03-07T10:20:25.000Z,Amatullah Hameed,GB,1.0

This was a bizarre experience from…,"This was a bizarre experience from start to finish.   I ordered a ring from their main site which produced a price in USD (while I was located in the UK).  The price was clearly marked as both $ and USD on their main page, in my cart, and in the summary confirmation that was sent to me after.  At which point Paypal confirmed the transaction I could see the same number was used but now in Euros instead of USD.   When I let them know - including all of relevant screenshots - I was informed that all countries operate slightly different and produce their own price - or some other nonsense to this effect never mind the fact I had an actual email confirmation as well clearly displayed in USD.  When I escalated I was told someone would get back to me.   Days and weeks passed in between their responses and when they did arrive, they lacked both professionalism and content or any resolution.  They left the order active but unfulfilled for some weeks  then just refunded me when Paypal ultimately refunded the difference based on the screenshots I had also sent them.  It took some 4 weeks of back and forth to not be able to complete my transaction.  I can’t be sure if this company is just incredibly inept or if it’s an outright scam.

The process is so frustrating and the email only customer service seems to add unnecessary delay. It takes days for a response and it remains unclear whether the issue is addressed.

This is an actual review of the product,All the negative reviews are a real surprise to me. I have been using the ring for two weeks now and it works great. Here is my assessment:Fit - I would suggest if you are between sizes on the sizing kit they provide you should go to the smaller one as the actual ring is a bit bigger but fits fine regardless.Quality and look - greatCharging - no problems at all and holds a charge for a long timeFeatures - as advertised with more coming in 2022I really like the sleep tracking as it has made me much more conscience of what impacts my sleep.I had one question for the customer support which they responded to quickly (although a bit obtusely) which resolved my question.  I like that I can sync my Strava workouts and activities to Apple Health which then syncs to the Oura app. They are moving to a subscription model but offer a very generous six month free trial. I will have plenty of time to decide if it is worth the $6 per month and how the promised new features turn out.

They do not have a customer service phone number, just a form to fill out.  I have filled out two online forms, reached out to them via Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.  Nothing has been resolved.  They say they are experiencing unprecedented customer service issues and are backlogged.  Well then, hire some more people asap and at least respond.

The sizing kit came to my address correctly - so they do have my correct address. Mid November I received the notice that the ring had shipped.  Long story short, the ring was sent to a non existent address (this has also happened to many other customers I have found out). The tracking number shows undeliverable address in another state and that it was returned to sender.  Over many weeks, I have e-mailed and messaged on Facebook dozens of times and tried every way possible to get to their customer service. For e-mail, I get the auto response ""it may take up to 7 days for customer support to respond to your issue"".  Those responses have gone on for 5 weeks!  When I message on FB, I get the reply ""please send more information"" with absolutely no other words - they don't say what info they want.  I have sent name, shipping address, tracking number, contact information, everything possible.  But, the only response is another auto response ""please send more information"".

Terrible company with non-existent…,Terrible company with non-existent customer service. The oura ring does not track my movements. I did a four mile run and it claimed I burned 3 calories in that time. The app is cumbersome and one of the worst Ive seen for a health device. I work in tech and have seen better with the Apple healthkit app. A cardiologist reviewed oura sleep tracking and found it to be totally inaccurate. I found his review online and had the same poor experience. I bought this product for sleep data and it failed to track accurately or store the data at all. You are better off tracking sleep manually (as I have) with the help of a sleep therapist.Returned this ring two weeks ago for a full refund and have not received any reply or refund from them yet. Done with online only companies. They have no customer service number. Seems to be a scam so Im disputing the charge with my credit card and warning others to avoid this company.,1,2022-01-08T14:42:09.000Z,DP,US,2.0

The product itself isn't bad for the period of time it works, but they've had serious issues with battery reliability, which is why they've cut the warranty period from 2 years to a year (in the US) - you will need to contact their customer service at some point.Three months my service ticket has been open, the first few correspondence was shift, as soon as it came to them having to actually action something, radio silence.Fair to say I won't be a returning customer, and I strongly caution anyone else thinking about becoming one, it is a gamble and the odds are not in your favour.",1,2022-01-08T10:50:17.000Z,Stuart Wallace,GB,6.0

I used to recommend Oura to all my clients and followers, but no more.Customer service is NONEXISTENT. They are beyond incompetent no one has responded to my email and 10+ follow-ups in over 3 weeks. The last time I had a problem it took them 2 weeks and more than 3 follow-ups.They canceled the wrong order, the one for my client, and NEVER REFUNDED ME MY MONEY.I already paid for my ring but because they were unable to ship to the correct address I still have not received that ring either. So far, 2 orders messed up, one canceled and no refund received, the other order still isn't fulfilled and NO ONE responds.This is by far the most frustrating experience I have ever had with customer (non-)service and I see Oura going out of business in no time. I'm surprised they haven't been sued yet for malpractice.All while they are running ads everywhere, even on TV. I can not for the sake of god understand how someone can be so incompetent to run a company this way and instead of investing in people & customer service, screw it up so big while paying stupid amounts for advertisement.Summary: Oura has gone completely downhill and needs to be considered a scam at this point.

The shipping company have admitted they have lost it so I told them I want compensation but apparently even though I'm the legal owner of the goods that doesn't matter the request for compensation has to be logged by The sender but the sender never bothers to reply so what am I meant to do this is caused me so much stress I am now taking both companies to the small claims court and will be claiming the compensation for the Lost ring as well as $2000 nzd in damages for stress and hurt feelings .

You really need to pop this ring on its charger every time you sit down, not just to feed its ravenous battery but also because that's often the only way to get it to sync.I should add that I have - as recommended - disabled battery optimization.",1,2021-12-30T16:47:36.000Z,Crosby Norbeck,US,1.0

Can you believe it? I can't even choose my own email address!  The company is absurd and now I wish I would have never upgraded and that's before I've even used the new Gen 3.

I’ve since sent back my gen 3 over 3weeks ago and upon doing so have discovered this company has disgraceful customer service. there is absolutely no phone to call, emails are carbon copy cut and paste which are truly aggravating and disingenuous.

UK customers charged £55 extra,"Not received the item yet, however am frustrated by the lack of clarity on the duty and customs fee during checkout.-I nearly always buy my products online; this is the first time this has happened-For a company who has nailed the user experience for their product, this feels very amiss-An extra 20% increase should not be tucked away in small print.Ultimately, if Oura flagged this extra fee (as they should), fewer people would purchase the item.

Oura is a victim of their own success - right now a bad buy,"Very very very disappointed. I have been a supporter of Oura since 2019 - was happy with the insights I got and the changes it allowed me to make to my lifestyle. Recently I was inundated with update and upgrade marketing for the new ring AND followed that lead some 7 weeks ago with the order and payment. The measuring rings arrived in time BUT since then total radio silence. My new ring never arrived and no inquiry as to when I can expect it is being answered seriously. I cancelled the order - received an automated confirmation to my cancellation within minutes without anyone seemingly being even remotely interested in recovering me as a client. Client focus, client support, client information and customer care seem to have been lost completely with Oura and they are clearly champions in annoying loyal clients. Maybe their success has overwhelmed them and they are missing the opportunity to salvage the situation. Unfortunately - no matter how good the new product may be - it is a total no go situation and one can not advice anyone to purchase this product for the time being.

Poor customer service (none existing ) Ring still not recieved,"Ticket number: 957036I was trapped into buying G3 ring with Oura new offer, I now regret that decision and I wish I didn’t order anything from Oura. Their customer service does not exist. Their product never received, and they do not respond to your query. My only hope now is to recover my money via my bank. Poor company not sure if they have staffing issues. If they do they should not market for a new product if they cannot support their customers. I should have received my order well over two weeks ago, received email from DHL asking me to pay for custom duty tax and processing fees which I did on 30th of Nov – (Transaction ID  64783094-14242642) I was not happy with this excessive and unexpected  fees but I thought I pay and get on with it but unfortunately DHL was  worse than Oura as they charged me ( Tax and extra fees) BUT sent the ring to Oura instead of sending it to myself. Poor service, so many attempts to contact Oura and DHL but no response. DHL finally – after a week said this shipment was handled by DHL express which apparently is different company and they cannot help. Oura on the other hand decided to not to communicate or respond to me (just an automated response with ticket number) Oura seem to be happy taking customers money and ignoring them, don’t really care if you even received the product. Oura failed several times, 1. No response to their customers despite several communications with them! Shocking!! . 2. Authorising DHL to charge extra fees for handling and not letting me know that there is Custom fees 3. Used incapable carrier such as DHL (or DHL express no one knows) despite bad DHL reputation – who charged me and sent the ring back to Oura. 4. Oura does not acknowledge there is a problem and not even reassuring me as a customer that they will sort this out. 5. This is very important Oura ring has no viable future compared with others similar products- I am almost certain Apple watch does many many more compared to Oura- apart from other functions at much better price and top quality customer service compared to Oura none existing customer care.

"Oura Ring “Update”, Oura Ring have gone above and beyond to rectify the situation. Along with a sincere apology. I have received the 3 generation upgrade and I’m happy with the product and service.","I agree with all the reviews with Oura Ring. I'm having the EXACT same issues as everyone else regarding Oura Ring.I ordered an Oura Ring September 17, 2021 and I was told that I can return it or exchange it until January 2022. I have continued to contact them since November, it's now December 14th...So that leaves me even fewer days to return/exchange the product. The source of contact is email, Instagram, and app. I have corresponded every way possible. After many correspondence they replied stating that they'll send me the RMA #  (Return Mail Authorization), I still haven't received it... although I continue to request the RMA #...Oura continues to send redundant automated replies telling me to click the link ""initiate a return."" Once it populates to input my order number and email it states that I have passed the 30 day return policy. I email Oura back explaining the situation and the redundant emails start all over again. This has been the worst purchasing experience that I've encountered in my 50 something years, and that's a lot of purchasing experiences. This is completely unexceptionable. At this point I don't want the product anymore. The remainder of my life is more valuable then having to deal with this. Purchasing a product is supposed to be an exciting and joyful experience.

Unresponsive support and incompetent order process equals no usable product,"I bought an Oura ring 29 of September 01. I received the sizing kit within a month. I confirmed my size and ordered the ring on October 6. Then I get a second sizing kit without explanation. I go check my order status and it says to confirm size. What?! I already did that. I confirm again, not realizing that they apparently changed the sizes and had sent me a newer Gen 3 size kit. While this might have felt like a nice gesture to them, this was just a foolish thing to do in the midst of a confirmed and open order with a pending status. So between Gen 2 and Gen 3 the sizes just also have changed a lot (wouldn’t Oura know this conversion themselves and not need to send two kits and expect me to figure out what was going on?!)I then get a ring that can’t even fit on my pinky. Support tells me to initiate an exchange. The status of the order, two weeks later the order asays “not yet shipped”. So then I finally get something to show as eligible for a return only and the eligibility date as being nearly a month in the past. Numerous unanswered emails to support. How we do one thing is how we do most things. I can’t imagine the tech and software for the ring that tracks health vitals can be all that good or trusted and reliable if a company can’t even get the shipping ordering and exchange tech down properly. That and the unanswered support emails tells me all I need to know. Now I can’t exchange and only return the ring that I was supposed to be able to get one free size exchange on. Again, no explanation. This is a product that is heavy on marketing but seemingly pretty lacking on follow through when it comes to caring for customers and getting products reliably into customer hands. So now, after three months, I’m back to no product and just lots of time and energy wasted trying.

It's a scam,Ringid mediocre at best. Doesn't read sleep accurately and it's overpriced honestly. Requested refund but the website is broken and claims my order number is wrong.

Terrible / non existent customer service,"I ordered a ring and paid £15 for delivery. On their website the FAQ say it is £15 to the UK so I read no further. Well, it turns out that the price of the ring plus shipping does not include import duties and other god knows what costs that businesses normally pay to the shipping provider. Altogether another £55 I had to pay to DHL!At first I thought it was a scam so I emailed customer service multiple times but got no response. There’s no number to call and seemingly they don’t answe emails, so you’re totally on your own once you click buy. I was going to return it, but to get a refund I had to return the ring to them, which I didn’t have. And there’s no way to contact them, so in the end I took the additional £55 hit because I thought it’s better to get the ring for an extra £55 than get nothing for £200+. Anyway, on reading the Oura small print it does say that customers have to cover this cost themselves, but it’s hidden away and the awful customer service made it all round a horrible experience.",1,2021-12-07T20:40:44.000Z,Ryan,GB,2.0
Difficult but ended up resolving issue,"Update:  I received a reach out from oura and they have corrected the order and refunded me. I appreciate their updated responsiveness and correction so am updating my review.  Prior issue:   I received the wrong size ring (warning if you order two rings in different sizes, they will send you both in the same size so better to place two different orders). I have reached out to the customer service email several times and they closed the ticket without addressing the issue.  Now I want to return both rings due to the lack of quality customer service but no one responds. The online return order system is not working and I would love a simple return address but they do not have a customer support response team who is actually answering customer support issues- instead it seems like an automated chatbot and no phone number available to speak with a live person.

Not very accurate at recording sleep patterns,I have the Gen 3 version of the ring. The beauty of this product is that its easy to wear all the time and track your body activity. The downside is that it doesnt really work in some respects and at night you can wake up and lie awake for hours whilst the ring records you as being asleep. The consequence is that the algorithms then tell you that you are 'ready for anything today' when in fact you could be completely knackered ! I contacted the company who basically said I was right and that it doesnt always work...!  What they should do is provide a way for you to edit your recorded sleep patterns so that perhaps the sensors could learn your individual patterns and report better. Maybe a future refinement - but this weakness does reduce the value of the ring somewhat.,3,2021-12-07T15:31:12.000Z,Nico,GB,25.0

So I have contacted customer service several times. Each time I get a canned response, a template which does not answer my question. I feel like I got conned by this bait and switch tactic. Customer service is horrendous. Which company says they will get back to within 7 days and then actually takes 7 days to give you a template response?Update Feb 3 2021: Still no update, still no response, still no refund for the ring I never received.",1,2022-02-03T21:50:18.000Z,Russel Beron,CA,4.0

I tried the exchange process which is again broken.  Entered the exact information (and variations thereof) multiple times only to be told it is not in their system.

Total disappointment,"I didn't own a Gen 2 ring, but I guess they were ok, product-wise. I bought a Gen 3 after Tim Ferriss promoted Oura on his podcast. The Gen 3 ring that I got is not a functioning product, it cannot connect to the phone via bluetooth and it simply does not work (cannot be set up). I am not making this claim lightly. I did spend several hours trying to find a solution online and troubleshooting the issue. I tried everything, eventually even tried different phones, and nothing works. I am sure there are people with perfectly functioning Gen 3 ring, but based on what I read online, quite many people didn't get that lucky. My guess is that they choose to get the new generation out before X-mass no matter what and released a half-baked, buggy product. To add insult to injury, Oura support really is non-existent, they provided no reply when I asked them about the issue. I personally don't mind the price, the subscription model, or the delayed shipping. I can be very patient with support, especially around this time of the year. But I now view Oura as mostly a great PR stunt, covering a disaster of a company and a flawed product.",1,2021-12-06T12:16:12.000Z,Vojtech,CZ,1.0
The worst customer support on the earth.,"It's full of problems.First of all, they have started selling the products in a haphazard manner even though the products have not been approved for export to Japan and cannot be shipped.They should immediately stop selling the product to Japan and other countries that cannot ship it as well, but there is not even a noticeable warning on the purchase form of the website.When I contacted customer support to cancel my purchase, the initial response was positive and they immediately processed the cancellation. They promised to process my refund within a few days, but it's already been three weeks.Many buyers on social networking sites have complained that their refunds have been withheld for more than a month, so it is not surprising that they suspect a scam.When I contacted customer support again to request a refund, I was told that ""refunds are handled by a different team,"" but isn't it the role of support to find out when a refund will be processed?The quality of the products and apps seems to have a certain reputation, but unfortunately the support is one of the worst on the earth.",1,2021-12-06T02:12:55.000Z,Takehiko Ono,JP,1.0

Fantastic Device let down by APALLING service,I've followed and recommended the OURA for a few years so when the Gen3 version came out I decided to order one each for myself and my partner. A couple of my ProLongevity clients who were happy with their gen2 rings (bought on my recommendation) gifted me their gen3 upgrades. NB this was a suggestion OURA actually made in their Facebook group. Cue a complete nightmare. Oura then completely mixed up my account with my clients' account. I got their emails. They got mine. Eventually the sizing kit turned up..(that took 20 or more emails) . Eventually both devices arrived but despite another 20 emails back and forth Oura customer services are too incompetent to disentangle the mess. The device is brilliant.

Very disappointed when I should be excited.,"Update:  my ring was shipped and received and I am learning the functionality.

Then saw the gen 3 was coming out so I waited. I ordered and they promptly took my money. I did not get confirmation of my order so I inquired. Five days later I got a confirmation of my order and the date was also delayed, but at least I’m in the system. They sent a sizing kit and I submitted my size. Then They sent an email saying my order status would be updated in two weeks. Not shipped…updated. That made me nervous. Then I see many other customers complaining with no replies. Then they send out an offer for $50 off. Wait!  Since they never sent my ring can I get that deal?  They ask me to send screenshots of the email I got. What?

It is disgusting that the company don’t make it clear this is payable. I’m sure it will be in some small print somewhere in their process, but it is certainly NOT made evident when they email you to say the product has been shipped to you. Be VERY aware before you deal with this company that they are not upfront and border on being devious with their customers. Customer service help emails suddenly stop arriving swiftly once you have actually bought and paid for the ring and you suddenly realise that you have another bill to pay to receive the ring.

Customer service / import duties,Ordered a gen 3. Didn’t make clear UK import duties post Brexit.  Disclosed in the small print but should have been more transparent given it adds 20% to the ring.  Oura Support’s way of dealing with it so far is to ignore me (and my 5 emails) and not respond. So so poor.

Worse customer service experience ever …,"I purchased a generation 2 ring without any problems. So I was more than willing to upgrade to the gen 3. I was offered a discount, not great considering my gen 2 ring wasn’t even three months old, but a discount and also free lifetime membership, which I thought would make up for the poor discount offer and so went for it.That’s where the issues began and just didn’t seem to end.Initially, although my basket showed the promised discount and the free lifetime membership, my card was charged full price and my receipt didn’t mention any kind of membership.Sadly, it took way too much stress and far too many emails to try and get this sorted out and as a last resort I started a credit card chargeback.Then they miraculously issued the discount as a part refund. Still no mention of the free lifetime membership.However, the problems and poor communication just continued to roll on in.After waiting for the ring sizer to arrive, which by the way is exactly the same sizing as the gen 2 and not really necessary, the website would not update with my ring size no matter how many times I tried or emailed them.By this time, with all the stress, I am definitely ready to just cancel and go for a different device. You really do have to experience it to believe it and know what I’m talking about. I am almost certain that this was set up this way on purpose to stall.So I tried and tried to cancel the ring. Nothing. Not a single response until I again contacted my credit card company to start the chargeback process again.I then miraculously got an email confirming my sizing as per my many emails.The ring finally came. Actually it came quite quickly by comparison and considering all the other issues and unanswered emails. I just can’t celebrate it. It’s much too little and far too late.The actual ring:I do like it and it seems better than the gen 2 ring but my purchasing experience has soured it so much that I can’t enjoy it.Because as well, as if the above wasn’t bad enough, the membership that I have isn’t lifetime it’s six months and I am still fighting this one out. If I don’t get what was promised in my upgrade email the I will definitely contact my credit card company, cancel the order and get a full refund, duties included.I will not be ripped off or messed around any longer.So, I tried to contact them to cancel again as I never buy any gadgets that have subscriptions attached (they’re just outright rips off) and I was sent so many fluffy email replies (not one of them actually answered my questions around when I would get the lifetime membership promised in my upgrade email).So, I have decided to cancel and return.I expect after this poor customer service this company cannot survive.",1,2021-11-26T16:58:37.000Z,Denise Mijatovic,GB,1.0

The customerservice was nothing but smooth and helpful all the time. I also descided to upgrade on the discount offer plus free lifetime membership. And I recevied my ring (in Germany) one week after it started selling. I didn't need customer service. I just waited out the storm. From my past experience I'd really suggest being a bit paitent. Oura is a small company that focusses on their product and that's why we love it. It now had a major rollout and thus is a little overwhelmed.

Money not refunded,"Horrible costumer service. I cancelled my order of the generation 3 ring on 4 November 2021.

On 17 November I had yet to receive my back and wrote asking for an update on the refund process.

As of this date I have yet to hear from them or get my refund. Oura seems unwilling or incapable of refunding my money, so I have filed a dispute with my bank and will be taking legal steps if necessary. For anyone thinking of doing business with the company, be aware that their costumer service is horrible, bordering on non existent and that they charge your creditcard immediately after placing the order, making cancelling complicated as they will need to actively refund your money.

Was about to order the Oura Ring in…,"Was about to order the Oura Ring in September until the Oura Twitter account tweeted “WAGMI” which is an acronym for “We Are Gonna Make It”. This led me to believe that the next Gen is on the horizon. I DM’d the Twitter account to ask if the new version was in the works and they said to stay tuned to the newsletter for information about the next ring update. So I did, I waited, and the Gen 3 was launched a month after!However, because of that conversation, I waited a few weeks for the Gen 3 and was surprised by a new subscription model UNLESS you purchased the ring previously, which I would have done had it not been for the Tweets and DMs from the Oura Twitter account. I explained my situation to them in DMs and they empathized and asked me to forward my situation to a support email address that they provided me with to have someone help me with my situation, but all I got from thag email was a generic response of their FAQs. I finally got a response from a human representative only for them to not be aware of the back and forth conversation through Tweets and DMs with the Twitter account and did not address to find a solution to my situation at all. Since then, they have been radio silent in both email or Twitter responses. This is been one of the worst customer experiences I’ve had with any company. To think that I went from being incredibly excited to join the Oura community and recommending family and friends to join me to being where I am now with how negatively I feel about this company is shocking. This launch was poorly planned, with a huge lack of communication and transparency. I will be taking this up with the BBB if my situation continues to go unaddressed and unresolved.",1,2021-11-04T19:46:37.000Z,Daniel Lam,CA,2.0

Worst customer service experience ever,"Early owner I bought my gen2 ring and received it July 20th. 3 months after Oura is releasing gen3 ring with tech updates with a membership fee to access their app and said they’re offering a discount and lifetime free membership for existing owner to thank them for loyalty and for being an early adopter. So I was supposed to receive the notification through email with a personal link to update to a gen3 ring the mentioned discount and lifetime free membership but I never received any email or notification. I wrote so many emails and messages but each time I received the same message that the email will arrive or already sent that I should keep on checking my inbox again and after several same kind of answer someone finally replied that If I haven’t received anything that means that I just haven’t been qualified for lifetime free membership and discount and that they’re sorry for the decision…So frustrating the Worst customer experience of my life, it’s really a shame and a pity knowing that I was a fan and recommending the product before that happened and I was ready to purchase the new ring.

Completely unacceptable customer…,"Completely unacceptable customer service.My Oura ring arrived September 13th.  The first day I put it on I emailed the company and asked why my vitals were not showing up.  I learned through the response that heartrate, etc. was captured only when I was sleeping; not sure how I missed that detail, but I did.  I was also sent a link to an article explaining that capturing vitals while I am awake is too hard.  Fast forward to October 26th and WOW, the company is offering the impossible - AND I can pay $200 more.  We exchanged too many preformatted response ""customer service"" emails before I received an email this morning by someone claiming that ""...we did not have concrete details about Gen 3 rings..."".  I also used FB Messenger to communicate with Oura, but I haven't heard back (yet); frankly, I don't expect any better answer if I do.Neat technology, but if this company is selling a luxury item (or at least one for people with disposable income) - then they need to do a MUCH better job.  The preformatted email responses are ridiculous, the claim that their own employees could not advise their customers so close to a new product release is ridiculous and unless this ring fails ahead of its expected lifecycle I don't think this purchase could go worse.11.2 Update:  Received a FB message ""...We experienced a huge amount of interest in the Oura Ring Gen3 launch, so we have a higher than usual influx of inquiries. We ask for your patience as we work to get back to everyone as quickly as we can...""11.17 Update: Nothing heard here or via FB.

Sneaky business practices,"I like the ring, but am posting this review as Oura has started to roll out sneaky business practices with planned obsolescence of the Oura 2 ring, reduced feature sets in the Oura 2 following release of the Oura 3, and stopping functionality up to 2 years from now (as a reference point, Apple gives 7 years for iPhones). This feels like a bait-and-switch, and I am deeply disappointed. I hope they’ll realise their mistake and roll back these changes, but until then, I would strongly advise against buying an Oura ring and getting into their ecosystem if this is how they treat their customers.",1,2021-10-30T12:03:19.000Z,Andrew,GB,4.0
"Forced membership that makes the hardware useless, because you can't access its data","When I pre-ordered my 3rd gen ring, I thought that the new membership model is optional after the 6 free months. I was under the impression that you only need to pay the monthly fee to get extra features in the app like videos, meditations etc. since I'm perfectly capable to interpret the data for myself or use third party apps like Welltory, Autosleep for data visualization.Now I read that they are even hiding the raw data output behind the paywall and no way to use the data from the ring like I want to! That's totally unacceptable! I'm not paying a high price for a hardware that I'm not able to use after 6 months! That's literally like buying a new TV that you are not able to use because you have to pay for Netflix to use it!

Appalled by their “Customer service” or lack there of!,"First and foremost, I love this product. I’m an advocate of what it stands for and leverage this information to optimize myself. I’ve put many friends  and family on to this product. However, the durability is questionable. I was in Alaska hiking,  and was traveling down a challenging trail, when we was climbing and was pulling myself up from a rock when my ring  broke.  I reached out to Oura to see if you would be able to replace my ring with no fees considering I received the ring less than a year ago and would fit under warranty I didn’t have a picture of  the broken ring as it fell off and landed somewhere I couldn’t find considering where I was! No changes are needed , only a replica of the stealth heritage that I had. CUSTOMER SERVICE should be important to most companies, doesn’t seem it’s a priority for this one. This was the response “ Unfortunately your case is not covered under warranty but I would like to offer a discount” you give discounts to people who dont even have rings! So, my response to the rep was “  wanted to inquire as to why the ring wouldn’t be under warranty if it was less than a year? When climbing,  the ring had cracked and broke as I was grabbing a rock. The durability and workmanship of the ring should of withstood the climb, as I used the ring in accordance to the purpose and with no abuse. I would of course love to get another stealth ring that I had, but my circumstances financially has changed over this year, would make it difficult to purchase another ring”. I guess there response to my message was nothing! No response and still waiting ! Way to treat clients that advocate your product! I’ll make sure to get out what this company really stands for! There bottom line with a B.S mission who dont care about the their customers!

Apologies for the wait, and thank you for your patience.Oura is clearly confused on what a return is vs an exchange. I sent a message using the Oura app to no avail. They sent me to the same link that doesn’t work. I sent two more messages using the app and both messages were closed with zero response to me other than this….The conversation has been closed.

They emailed back to say we could easily change size and color. All we had to do was adjust online when we confirmed the size after using the sizing kit.Well guess what, no way to change color online when confirming size. We had to email ""Customer Support"" with our order number and our requested colors and sizes.Customer Support emailed us back confirming the order with the wrong color. We emailed them again.. and again the emailed back the wrong color. So we emailed them a third time and the emailed us back with the correct color and sizes, but that our order had been placed on-hold.It has now been a week, we have emailed and messaged on IG and FB and still no response. Our next step is to contact our credit card company and have them deal with them.My wife and I were so excited to get these rings.. the total lack of customer service,  not to mention no way to call, has turned this anniversary present into nothing but frustration.

A number of annoying flaws,"I like getting the ring's feedback but find a number of flaws really annoying. They added a feature to capture naps resulting it saying I'm asleep (even deep sleep) when I watch TV. Totally screws up the validity of the sleep feedback. Also it labels my lowest heartrate of the night as a ""recovery"" indicator but it always simply corresponds with me being awake and practicing deep breathing to go back to sleep. It's also annoying to have an algorithm choose ""my goals"" and then ding me for not meeting them. One bizarre flaw is that the day after I workout long and hard, I get dinged for the previous days poor activity level. What the hell?And why does it set a goal for me to go bed at 8:30 or 9pm? That's ridiculous. It constantly tells me I have zero REM sleep when I always am aware of dreaming when I awake at any point during the night.

Fantastic service!,"Fantastic service!Had an issue with the battery, seems a common fault but with technology this small I guess it would be. Anyway, I reached out to oura about 10 days ago (sept 2021) and they took a look at the data at their end and confirmed I had a battery issue.  They asked a few questions and we had a few email exchanges. They're a few hours behind (or maybe ahead) of us in the UK but the responses were all timely. Anyway, long and short they confirmed the battery had an issue and couldn't be fixed so they'd send me a new ring. I've had the original since maybe Jan 20, possibly Dec 19, but a little under 2 years anyway. Said replacement has just come in the post today, so end to end it's been maybe 2 weeks. All of the horror stories I'm reading about their customer service, that just hasn't been my experience.  So either they've sorted their CS out or the reviews on here have been from exceptionally unlucky people. Personally I can't commend them highly enough.  The way I see this, the battery has lasted 18 months or so, the replacement was a freebie, so if that lasts 18 months more then I'll have had 3 years out of this piece of tech, which in tech terms is very good. (most people don't keep tech much beyond a year, think phones etc). So 3 years for a single cost of maybe 250 quid I think is superb On a note I have to say i really love the app too, it's been an excellent companion every morning, suggesting how well I slept, monitoring my temp and HR and them measuring how active I am during the day. I have a fitbit as a companion for this ring but I feel the oura app is better (for me).

Warning extra charges/ delays UK customers,I was interested in their ring but after jumping through hoops to get the ring was asked to pay a further £54 import taxes as well as £14 for delivery of a sizing kit and the ring itself. On top of that I had to pay £6.80 exchange fee from my bank.  That amounts to a further £75 extra and I'm refusing delivery.I would say your business model is seriously flawed if you expect UK customers to pay these charges and wait a week for the kit and another for the ring.  It would suggest to me you don't have the logistical set up for what I'd have thought would be a major market.  I now have to apparently request to cancel my order ( you have to pay upfront just to get the sizing kit).  Request?  Isn't that a statutory right?

I contacted Oura and got a replacement ring, but that ring's charge was even worse!  My battery no longer even lasts for a day, and my ring in only about a year old.This forced me to contact Oura again, but they would no longer replace my ring due to it being out of the warrant period.  They had the audacity to offer me a $50 discount for a new ring to make up for it!  To sum it all up, the Oura ring pretty much costs about $150 per year...which is about the same price as replacing a high-end smartphone.  I would highly recommend staying away from this product.

So I felt that after a year of use I…,"So I felt that after a year of use I would share my experience with this incredible ring concept. I received my first ring in August. My sizing was required to be a size 7 which would be on my left index and middle finger depending on winter and summer. In December the ring stopped charging altogether and it took two weeks with support to get my new ring issues settled and a new one sent. And then new ring worked fine for about six months when the Bluetooth stopped working and the gold coloring that I paid an extra hundred bucks for was completely wearing off. Again I was under warranty and it took several weeks to get the issue cleared before I could ship my order back and receive a new one. It took only two days to receive the new one once shipped(a rapid response I must say). Now, unfortunately, my 3rd ring in just over a year) the size is inconsistent. Whereas the previous size seven was slightly snug to generally snug on my left index and middle finger this one is loose and falling off both fingers. It says that it is a size 7 but there's no way that is correct. I tried on the demo ring again in case my finger size changed(doubtful at 55 years old).  The size seven demo fits perfectly. I am barely able to wear this without falling off and I know I'll not be able to wear this in the winter unless I flip it over to my dominant hand which I would prefer not to do because again it would wear off the coloring.  Love the tech concept and really love the data but have I been fraught with issues of gold color wearing off with usual daily activity, battery failing on the first ring, blue tooth and color failing on second(replacement under warranty) and now my 3rd ring size is too big and not accurate.

Having purchased so much stuff online that has not required tax, I clearly never considered it . Choice : Pay the extra …👎 or … return it & receive a refund Minus their shipping costs 👎.  Not much of a choice really- BUYER BEWARE, we are no longer part of the EU.!  It’s definitely given me the hump .",2,2021-08-24T10:40:48.000Z,karen,GB,16.0
Oura ring good for 8-9 months only.,"Edit final:25th Aug I received the second warranty replacement ring. This was sorted out much more quickly than the first.  And as Oura are happy to point out on their website, the battery is a consumable and not reason for warranty. This second ring, like the first, clearly failed due to BT or other chipset. I personally believe complaining here on a public forum sped up the replacement and encourage others to do the same if their ring fails. Meanwhile, I’ve lost two more weeks of data.  And the only real usefulness of these kinds of devices is the long term baseline they create. Summary: very solid software/UI. Helpful information for better living.  Poor hardware - they should invest in more robust chipsets even if it raises the rings price. MTBF should never be less than 24 months.  Edit: 20th Aug.  Oura warranty team inform me that they will send a replacement ring. ""warranty orders are moved to top of their shipping queue.""  Shipping normally within 1 week. Edit 19th Aug.  Oura support say, ""After reviewing your Oura Ring's data, we have discovered an issue with your ring"".  Then proceed to tell me to inform them of my ring details, including order number (this second faile ring is a warranty replacement of the first) so that my order can be referred to their warranty support team for review.  Takes 2-3 business days. Edit:  18th Aug, Oura support respond on 16th Aug with their standard form ""is it plugged in"" script as nearly all first line support teams are forced to do.  We're still answering their questions.  The ring's bluetooth still is not visible on any device (iOS or Android) with all other 2.4Ghz radio sources isolated. Perhaps the battery is too weak to turn on BT, perhaps bt chip died.  I'm waiting for them to tell me that this replacement ring is out of warranty. Edit after Ouraring comment on my review below:Ouraring support. I never said battery.  First ring failed during firmware update.  Second ring just lost BT Connectivity. Both rings still show white led on charging base - eg not a battery issue. Both failures are your core hardware, not the battery. Stop trying to cover things up and fix the poor hardware builds. If you have so much time to troll the blogosphere - then you should rewrite your public FAQ stating the “battery life” story you explain below.  And answer my support question that I opened in the app on the 14th. Original review entered 14 Aug 2021:Bought a used Oura from Finnish secondhand market. December 2019. Worked great. The guy I bought it from had used it for two months.  Did it’s thing like it says. Until it failed in September 2020. Thirty days of “customer service” frustration and they sent a replacement. November 2020 all is good again.  Mid August 2021 ring stops connecting. Of course the question is why bother. The data is good. But 8-9 months from a piece of tech.  It’s poor. No wonder the price is steep - it’s not the materials or development. It’s the cost of replacement!! Horrible.",1,2021-08-28T09:26:47.000Z,Johnjhelsinki,FI,1.0

Rings fails at about 2 years- a battery issue. And BEWARE UK IMPORT TAXES ADD £58 to order but you don’t find this out until DHL notifies you,Clearly a battery issue that they are not dealing with. I bought mine in 2019 May… last two weeks stopped connecting to a iPhone when off the charger. Of course 2 months out of warranty. Enough complaints here to indicate a durability issue after 2 years. So funny to read their boiler plate responses… written by lawyers avoiding product issues that are pretty clear here. I was offered a $75 discount on buying. A new ring. Disappointed that the product life is probably 2 years or less. Otherwise I loved it and have had 3 friends buy rings in the last 3 months- on my recommendation.PS Just notified by DHL I need to pay customs duty of £58.38…. Hence wiping out the $75 trade in discount. Given the number of UK complaints on here why aren’t they notifying UK customers directly of expected extra charges!!! This is such BS to note the small print in the order that gives one no idea of the significant extra costs of purchasing this for the UK!!! Just not acceptable! If I could cancel this new order now I would. Really not acceptable way of hiding issues ( better life)  and extra costs for UK… not the right way to treat customers. You have lost a one time big fan!MY RESPONSE TO OUTA COMMENT I had already read this same boiler plate excuse/explanation  on other online reviews. Who cares about your justification!?!?You know there is an issue for UK based clients and you have had numerous complaints and you continue to hide behind the small  print in your terms.ADDRESS the issue CLEARLY upfront by notifying UK clients of the estimated UK VAT - which is not a secret! Do this upfront and don’t leave it to DHL to notify customers of this. Stop the hiding and be upfront about it,1,2021-08-10T18:57:02.000Z,timmys,GB,3.0

The Oura ring is short-lived. No compensation is offered for malfunctioning rings,"In 2019 I purchased an Oura ring. I have enjoyed its sleep monitoring functions. However, the life-time of a ring is less than 1 year. In the meantime my second replacement ring (3rd ring thus) failed and the fault was diagnosed as ring malfunction. I hence asked for a new replacement which was denied and I was informed that warranty only applies as of the starting ring, so, in my case 4 months overdue. Here is the answers I finally received on 20 July 2021:""Thank you for the reply and we apologize for the frustration and inconvenience caused. Here at Oura, we want to thank you for being a loyal customer through these years. Unfortunately, we are not able to replace your ring. To clarify, your original ring was shipped to you on the 18th of Feb 2019 and your 2 year warranty period began from the receipt of this original order.

Oura Accuracy and longevity???,"I believe the Oura ring excels in monitoring resting heart rate, HRV and nightly temperature variations.  As with all sleep trackers, sleep stages can not be accurately measured using only a PPG and accelerometer.  However,  my Oura ring did help me achieve and maintain a consistent sleep schedule.Unfortunately, my Oura Ring lasted just over two years.  I was charging the ring recently and the ring no longer connects to my iPhone. In fact, the Oura ring is no longer visible to any Bluetooth device scan (android of iOS). I believe, the ring's software/firmware has turned off Bluetooth (airplane mode) and is in an non-recoverable error state or the Bluetooth transceiver is defective.   I contacted Oura and was offered $50 off a replacement ring.  I plan to wait for another future device with better accuracy and longevity. RL",3,2021-07-26T14:42:40.000Z,RML Tracker,US,1.0

Spend your $ for something better,"I have been using this new version since August 2018; one before that was a huge ring that kept my finger wet for a long time after washing hands. The warranty is only for 2 years, so of course something wrong happens after that. It hasn't been 3 years yet, but I had to charge it every night even though they said it lasts up to a week. Every other day the battery runs out within a day. I contacted the customer service, and they told me to buy another one. I asked the customer service the ring only lasts less than 3 years?! What do you think? Did they answer that? Of course no, they ignored my email. You decide if paying $100 each year for 3 years for it which breaks before the 4th year is worth for you.Update; As soon as this was read by Oura, I got the reply both here and my email.

Oura Ring a Great Product- With a FATAL flaw.,"Great Product.  Awesome Product actually.  Why only a 1 star you might ask ?Take the below advise from an early adopter. Here is my Oura Ring review. I have brought 5 Oura rings for friends and referred another 10 odd people. So yeah I was a real fan and promoter ( Which I wish I had not now)  Warning: The Orua Ring has one FATAL flaw.  As you can see from the growing number of negative reviews on what is / should be a best in class productThe ring battery will die on you, its not a matter of IF just a matter of WHEN.  It is not changeable, so you have to buy a complete new ring.  So simply put it is a disposable product. If you are UNLUCKY your ring will last 2 years and probably die very soon after. After 2 years you are out of the warranty period, so tough luck. ( Not that I have heard of one lasting 2 years. )If you are lucky, as I was, the ring will fail at about 14-16 months which is standard from what I can see. I got a brand new warranty replacement and the battery lasted 14 months.  So I got 2.5 years use out of 2 rings and others I know of  that brought rings over a year or so ago have had to get replacements because of the battery issues. I think that Oura needs to address this up front with potential clients.  As long as they some how get you to 2 years. They will simply walk away, with full knowing on the day you purchased it that the battery was going to fail.Hope on the next version they address, it as apart from that fatal flaw,  I am a fan of the product. I just hope that the business can survive till V3 with the battery issues resolved.And check the yet to be posted ""canned reply"".  It will be a copy and paste.  So don't take it like they actually want to own this issue.Edit to response:  Yes a pretty much canned reply. Lets address it :""such as the age of your ring"" All the rings I am aware of are Brand New ""usage of ring features ""   (e.g. Moment)  A new feature on Andriod that was used a Total of ZERO times on my first failed ring ""completing a firmware update, ""  I would think this was a joke, if they were not repeating it over and over. .  They are pushing their own software to their own ring once every month or so that destroys the battery.   LOL ""have a limited lifespan"" Yes in Oura rings case VERY LIMITED Beware this is not like when a phone battery dies. When this battery goes it goes to unusable in light speed.",1,2021-06-18T03:52:58.000Z,Al Hall,NZ,11.0

GREAT PRODUCT - Does have battery issues & you have to fight for your rights,"UPDATED - After much chasing, Oura finally came back to me & denied honouring my warranty. But I wouldn't accept this. In the end, they replaced my ring under warranty & I am now pleased to say I have a new ring. I look forward to seeing how this one goes. I hope that my first one was just faulty & this one lasts more than 6 months.My advice - don't be prepared to give up. If you have an issue then insist that they replace it.Such a shame as I love the ring but I just can't be enthusiastic about the after care & warranty process.However, I finally got there & I have given 4 stars on that basis.BUYER BEWARE - this product will only be effective for around 3-6 months!I love the idea of the Oura ring & I love the data it gives me. However, I bought mine brand new (still wrapped) from someone on eBay. It was a genuine Oura ring & like I said the wrapping wasn't even opened so I was the first person to own it & use it. However, after less than 6 months, the battery started to fail & rather than getting 2-3 days, I was lucky to get 1 day from it. I contacted Oura & they said that they could only replace it if I could supply the serial number & the purchase receipt. I contacted the bay seller but they didn't have the receipt. What I don't understand is that with me syncing to the Oura software every day they can access the serial number & they can see the first time it was used. They can see that it failed in less than 6 months but they won't do anything about it because I don't have a receipt. So, I spent $500 on a ring that is effectively useless after 6 months and I can't get any support for it. BTW - it's now not even holding a charge for a day so my $500 ring was useful for less than 6 months, partially useful for the next few months & now effectively a dud.A lot of money for a very poor product & poor service :(I know that I didn't buy it from a store but as with all electronics that sync each day, Oura has full information on my product & its history so it's disappointing that they won't do anything about it.REFERENCE: 439655",4,2021-07-13T08:15:59.000Z,Debra Chantry-Taylor,NZ,1.0

Stung with large import duty to UK,"If you are a UK buyer please be aware of the import duty/vat (£54.86) which you will receive in the post months after your purchase. Although the company do state at the point of order that there will be import charges for some countries, there is no indication of quite how substantial this is. I for one had no experience or understanding of the scale of the charge, presuming VAT was in the price. They may have fulfilled a legal obligation with this disclaimer, but it's pretty shoddy customer service, not to make this more transparent, as it is a new T&C as a result of Brexit. Surprising for a company that seems to pride itself on the support for the use of the ring. Somewhat tarnished the whole experience.......Addendum - I've just done some research and (according to Which) it seems that no duty is charged on products manufactured in the EU - so I am a little confused as to why DHL have billed me this long after delivery, and why Oura themselves were not able to point this out to me....",1,2021-06-06T17:22:11.000Z,morny wright,GB,9.0
Problems Faced by One of Oura's First Customers,"I am one of Oura's 1st customers. As a former personaI trainer, I highly anticipated product and ordered it in December 2018. Although I helped consult as an independent contractor on Amazon’s Halo fitness band, I fully subscribed to the promise of Oura’s technology and ability to advance the fitness industry. I've had 2 (now maybe 3 because it has stopped working) rings that have broken even though I have taken exceptional care of the rings. There always seems to be an issue (not changing, not syncing, poor battery life, etc)Aside from the hardware, I have faced a number of other customer service issues:For example, I originally ordered the silver ring - which scratchs easily. Because of this, I regularly take off my ring when exercising / lifting and have to manually input data. After my 1st & 2nd rings broke, I asked that the replacements be sent in black because the silver scratches so easily and looks terrible. However, they said this was impossible. This made no sense as regardless of color, the ring is the same price/model- a seemingly minor request was made out to be a big deal and ignored.  I hope things can be resolved. But for now I have recommending my training clients to use fitbit and the Amazon halo band to track fitness/health. I have been continuing to use the Oura ring because I cannot stand wearing bands/watches on my wrist. But if this third ring is not fixed/resolved, I will likely have to move on and find a different product.",2,2021-06-02T14:49:57.000Z,Cameron Huard,US,1.0

A happy experience with Oura customer service.,"Bought a ring at Christmas, love it (data geek). Only problem - the battery suddenly died after 6 months. Looking at the umpteen negative reviews here I suspected this might turn out to have been an expensive and short lived experiment. However, an email to Oura about the problem got a reply overnight asking for more details. The next day they followed up (presumably having looked up data from the ring) to say ""yes, the battery has failed, a replacement ring will be sent ASAP, just recycle the old one, we don't need it back"". A week later, the new ring arrived and is now happily setting up.  Only 4 stars because ideally, the original ring wouldn't have died so soon, but can't fault the customer service.

But after a couple of firmware updates and App updates, my ring doesn't even last one night, and that's the most important feature.I LOVED my ring. I had ZERO complaints. Hell, I even recommended it to all my friends that buy this over an Apple Watch. But now I will much rather spend my money buying something else now. I genuinely do not believe battery health drops right off the cliff like it did with my ring. We have all experienced battery issues, be with with our phones, or laptops; they degrade consistently over time. This literally dropped off, perfectly normal operation, didn't notice ANY battery issues at all.The first thing I do after waking up is to sync the ring. On the 17th May, the app couldn't find the ring. I thought, thats strange, it never happens, and I charged it just yesterday as I always do if I do the dishes. It was only until I searched, ""Oura Ring Battery suddenly.."" that Google autocompleted it straight to Trustpilot reviews. Disheartening.Lithium ion battery should last about 500 charge/discharge cycles. With a 4 day (full to zero) battery, the ring should last at least 5.5 years, and even longer if you know how to maintain batteries better.And SURELY it won't happen over night. Unless there is an issue with the firmware and a fix is coming to restore the battery life it accurately has, I am convinced this is planned obsolescence.",1,2021-05-22T12:11:20.000Z,Rohan,GB,7.0

AVOID at all costs,"AVOID at all costs. Trust me, the service is so so so bad.I wish I'd read about the customer service and dysfunctional product before buying.You buy a product that doesn't work brand new out of the box.

One of the worst customer service…,"One of the worst customer service experiences i have had in the past several years. I enjoyed using the ring and looking at the data everyday. The charger suddenly stopped working. I have only had the ring for 5 months. I tried all the trouble shooting tips and my husband who is an engineer also looked at it...its no longer working which makes the ring useless. I reached out to customer service, via the app, website and facebook message. No response beyond an automated email. I am asking for a replacement charger (its still under warranty) or a full refund of the purchase of the ring. This is an expensive purchase for most of us and i want those of you who are considering this to go into it with your eyes wide open.",1,2021-05-12T18:52:27.000Z,judy hopkins,US,1.0
Disappointing customer service,"I wish I could give this company a better review. The first time around was a great experience and I loved the ring itself, but having to deal with a replacement size has been a nightmare.I requested a size exchange in early April and mailed my original ring back on April 13. They shipped out a replacement ring immediately. This package then got lost via USPS, and their response time was a bit slow when I brought it to their attention - I emailed a few times asking them to check on it starting 4/22, they asked me to wait 1 more week to see if it turns up, which was fine. Then emailed again 4/29 and 4/30 with no response for 4 days. Finally they offered to send a replacement, this time via UPS, which was allegedly mailed out 5/3 with an anticipated arrival on 5/5. The package has been stuck at the ""label created/UPS awaiting package"" stage since then. I emailed again on 5/6 to ask if it had been sent out, and they said they would check with the carrier and get back to me. No updated provided. Emailed them again on 5/7, and again today. Still no response.Truly disappointed as I really loved the product and I've been dying to get it back. It's been a month now since initially attempting the return. The lack of communication and updates is extremely frustrating. At least some response indicating that they are working on the issue would make this a bit more bearable.",2,2021-05-10T19:50:05.000Z,Gabrielle Czernik,US,1.0

Great Product & Companion App,"I’ve had this ring since March of 2019. I’ve liked it from the start. I did have a problem with my first ring. It was under warranty and they sent me a replacement relatively quickly without hassle. It came from Europe I believe, so it did take a little bit. I wasn’t worried about it though as my expectations were set. Since then I have not had any problems with my ring. I love the data insights it provides me and the fact that I only need to wear the ring to get the data. Since it has been a couple years I do wonder how much longer this particular ring will last. Unless Oura offers some type of significant trade in replacement discount, I’m not sure I can justify the additional expense for a new one when the time comes.",5,2021-05-03T17:18:18.000Z,Keith G,US,7.0
"Great product, reliable service!","Both me and my wife are one of the early adopters of Oura, we purchased our rings back when you had to wait a few months to have it shipped ;-).Since then we gifted Oura to a few friends, and always the process was smooth and reliable.In particular, after the first year my own ring stopped charging properly and all it took was 1 email with information to have the company send me a replacement; the same happened to one of my friends, and she also had the replacement shipped quickly.In addition, something that I don't think is obvious, the company keeps improving the app – getting better at understanding the sleep data – without any pressure to have you upgrade to a new version, or purchase anything additionally.It is entirely possible that some Silicon Valley fund could have pushed a similar company to start a subscription service or release a new model each year to keep the revenue up, but in the case of Oura, the company displays commendable integrity.My only wish would be to actually get some updated models for the rings where they would collaborate with the Nordic designers for a few limited editions – there are so many classic Finnish designs (e.g. Tapio Wirkkala). As a happy user who used the ring for a few years, I'm both happy to give Oura a bit more money and eager to get some updated look for my ring.",5,2021-04-29T11:54:44.000Z,Monsieur Sergei Klimov,LT,7.0

Huge shipping taxes not mentioned in original price,"I have just had my ring shipped. Separate to this I have been sent a £56 bill by DHL that was not stated anywhere in the original payment. Although I payed I am not happy that I had to do so since if this had been in the pricing originally that would have heavily affected my choice to purchase. This was already a stretch of the budget. It seems obvious to me that there quoted “shipping and taxes will be calculated during checkout” is extremely unclear and does not account what so ever for this additional cost. They are aware of this (just look at all of the complaints about this specific situation that ours claims to have taken into account) yet still have done nothing to compensate customers or fix this. It is obvious that they are doing this inorder to make the ring seem much more affordable, or would have done something about this by now. As others have said further actions should be taken as ours refuses to handle the situation.",1,2021-04-21T18:03:42.000Z,Joe,GB,1.0
"The ring is OK, their software is not","The ring is OK - it doesn't record sleep well. I've gotten up on bad nights to physically mark a piece of paper that I'm awake. It missed 8/8.The software is also garbage. Runs down phone battery and their latest update trashed the ring. It can't connect at all and their only solution was ""download the app fresh every single time you want to open it"". Pathetic.You also need to have the ring on the charger to then re-pair it. Every charge cycle, however short, reduces the battery lifecycle. So you end up needing a new product 10x faster. I'm sure they're devasted about that... not that I'll be buying a new one.",1,2021-04-19T17:26:34.000Z,Dan,GB,7.0

I submitted a ticket with customer support through the app. After 3 days with no response Oura closed the ticket on their end. I was able to get through to the return team and get a return number, but I'm disappointed it came to that. There's no way (I can tell) to call or chat with a human so I don't know what happened and don't have more time to spend trying to get through.",1,2021-04-12T17:21:56.000Z,Christina Kiel,US,1.0

I sent a pre-purchase enquiry to Oura Sales last Saturday and received a response almost immediately. Now that I am querying the additional charges, they have gone quiet. After sales seems to be a very different experience with this company.I was looking forward to using the ring, but I feel that I have been mislead to the point that I now simply want my order cancelled and the money refunded.

I work in tech and i get that the tracking is an approximation but this was totally off. Also the biggest ring size was uncomforable during nights. But that is subjective of course.As for the support, i told them about my problems and asked to return the ring, after some back and forth i got my RMA number and sent the Ring back with the original packaging via DHL.

Faulty new ring and Oura ghosting - Don't buy,"Wish I'd seen these reviews before I bought the ring.  I was shocked by an added £74 tax bill which took the ring well over what already seemed a pricey sum, which now make the Apple Watch look more interesting. Never a good idea to make a competitor look good. The ring was very difficult to connect to my Iphone.  Four days in it started to have faults.  Today is 8 days in and I'm told by Oura that it is faulty (at least I didn't have to tell them that) and they want my details to pass on to the warranty department (which sounds like a stall).  Feeling very glum having read the other reviews.  I feel taken for a ride and it looks like I may struggle to get a remotely reasonable resolution in a reasonable period of time. Very ironic as the ring is about improving sleep and all this is doing is adding stress to my life. So now it's a five day wait for a warranty person to  check the warranty. Watch this space - I'll let you know if this is resolved well and quickly - before you spend nearly £400 on trying to improve your sleep. So 10 days since Oura told me they would check my warranty and I've heard no more, no response to reminder emails.  While I had been willing to have a replacement this now comes across as a scam - the company and product are not what is suggested by their PR machine.",1,2021-03-18T11:49:21.000Z,penny vera-sanso,GB,21.0

They ‘forgot’ to send me the correct reference numbers for the pick up. They use UPS for shipments and pick up, and they are totally inefficient outside of the USOura are a new company who have a LOT to learn about customer service.

Excellent product,"I have been using the Oura ring since March 2020. I have to say that in monitoring my night resting heart rate, sleep and activities this ring is better than the Fitbit and Apple Watch that I have. I truly prefer Oura and their way of analyzing my data. The ring stopped working in December and it took one month for the customer service to send me a new ring after I sent more than 10 emails. So 5 starts for the ring, customer service needs to improve as it’s letting down a really good product. I would probably want to see heart rate monitoring during the day being added and daily heart rate analyze to make this even better than Fitbit and Apple apps together.

Stuck with a ring too small...,"My daughter ordered the ring as a gift. It was too big (size 9). We used their sizing recommendations (size 7). The replacement was too small. When we tried to return it they told us only one return. Never programmed and in the case of the size 7, never even on my finger. I would be happy to pay postage to return it. Never given an option. Just a terse email saying no more returns. Now, I guess we have to sell this one on Ebay. And, the response time for communications with them can be LONG. So, if you have a problem don't expect that it will be resolved quickly, or in my case, that it will be resolved at all.",1,2021-02-24T16:39:33.000Z,Michael Chambers,US,1.0

The answer of a 15 days old ring......after review a solution,"The answer of a 15 days old ring......Thanks for reaching out to us about your scratched ring.Each Oura Ring’s shell is made of titanium and is coated with a diamond-like carbon(DLC) or physical vapor deposition(PVD) finish depending on the ring color, for improved scratch resistance.• Titanium with PVD coating in silver and gold-colored rings.• Titanium with DLC coating in all other models.Despite this, certain activities may result in scratches to your ring's exterior. Here are a few best practices to avoid scratching or damaging your ring's exterior:• Wear the ring on your non-dominant hand to reduce the amount of potential contact with various surfaces (this can also help with receiving more accurate activity data).• Avoid wearing other rings below, on top, and next to your Oura ring.• Remove your Oura ring in situations that may result in excess friction (i.e. weightlifting), or when handling other objects made of metal or stone.Unfortunately, physical damage, like scratches, are not covered under our warranty. Therefore, a replacement is not an option under our current policy. You can find our Terms of Use (Warranty Information) here.We understand situations like this are frustrating. Please let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.In good health,Viena | Oura SupportI send a reply mail, but no answer........ on my replyDear Employee,This is not a very pleasant answer. The ring has only been worn for 15 days and is now ready for it. My mother does not do any physical work, so there are not many chances of damage. I expect better quality for a ring of 400 euros. I would like a solution.It is not a solution to refer us to the warranty policy. I had already read that myself before the purchase. Every ring that you can buy at oura clearly states that it is scratch resistant. If a ring is damaged in such a short time, it is not scratch resistant. If you agree, your text on the website is very mislead.If no solution can be found, I would like to return the ring and we will cancel the purchase because the product does not meet our expectations.To be on the safe side, take the photo of the ring. So it should be black!I would like to hear what is still possible.Your request (633184)after posting the review, oura contacted anyway and provided a good solution. communication could be better masr the solution is ultimately good.",3,2021-02-19T18:59:48.000Z,Ruben de Kleine,NL,1.0
Customer service review,"Just received the £70 tax bill I see others have also been surprised by. I recognise this is due to the UKs exit from the EU but really disappointed with the lack of transparency on checkout. Order SO-10331623 if you want to look into in Oura.Update:Ring not quite with me so a customer service review for now. I’ve contacted Oura twice; once to check they had my size (oddly the order was showing with size on my phone but not via laptop), and once to discuss import tax. Both times they responded really promptly and were super helpful. Really happy with the outcomes and look forward to receiving the ring and adding a product review.

£70 Customs Tax Surprise - UK,"I purchased an Oura ring from their website last week. I am from the UK and have been hit with a huge £70 customs tax bill this morning. After Googling the issue it seems it is very common for people to be surprised by this bill as the company fails to make this clear at the point of purchase. It seems they explain the buyer is responsible for customs tax in their T's and C's but they could so easily be up front and honest about this when you select your country on the website.Instead they don't see this as their problem, and are happy to have buyers surprised with this bill.Oura; all I can do is leave you a bad review here as I am very dissatisfied with the purchase experience so far. I hope that you will continue to receive bad feedback and that this will make you change your website and clearly highlight customs tax to your customers, so that they are not surprised in future.",1,2021-02-17T08:46:49.000Z,Grant Thomas,GB,2.0

HIDDEN CHARGES,I’ve received the ring. And a whopping £60 customs bill. I’ve been given a cop out response blaming the EU for me having to pay another 1/4 of the cost of the ring. Ridiculous.

"Same as everyone else, terrible customer service","So... like everyone else my experience is generally based around terrible customer service.  The product itself was ok, but I just found it interfered too much with my work (I work a lot with my hands).Having arrived promptly enough - 5-7 days delivery for both ring sizing kit and actual ring arriving - trying to send it back is a whole other matter.  It took them two weeks to respond to my initial request to return it (which judging by some of the reviews on here was actually quite fast for them) so having received the information I sent it all off, only to find that after 3 weeks, it has been sitting in a UPS warehouse because they haven't provided UPS with the right information!! And now UPS are returning the ring to me!!!! The utter incompetence of these people is staggering.  And they haven't responded to any of my follow up emails after the last two weeks asking why they haven't given UPS the information...It really isn't worth buying anything from these guys, because if there are any problems they won't do squat, and you're £300 out of pocket.  Another dodgy vendor that's going to have to be made to pay up in court.Edit: Why is it you can respond to bad reviews the same day, but it takes two weeks to get a reply to refund request, and even then you can't actually make the effort, despite having 3 weeks to do so, to get the item returned?",1,2021-02-05T17:00:18.000Z,Alex,GB,21.0

I opted for a refund instead and they responded right away each time after that. Thankfully, I got my refund.

But when the ring arrived it was grey and a bit larger, the the sizing kit item (so I recommend to order a bit tighter then ""perfect""). And for over a month I am trying to return the Ring, so I can order a new one (Black with smaller size), but the customer service is completly ignoring my letters, not responding to any issues with the return I am struggling to resolve.

SICK OF REVIEWS ABOUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE ACTUAL PRODUCT?! READ ON..,"Leaving one star because you're angry with people is ridiculous...I know its frustrating, but people need a review of the product not just the service!!!The ring itself is a fantastic investment! It's so accurate and has prompted me to work harder in my work outs (by showing me data about my daily activity score and readiness) and have earlier nights due to its notifications and advice. I could no longer use the Fitbit/apple watches as I have tattoos on both wrists...new technology does not allow the leds to penetrate through tattoo pigment- awful design flaw they will not tell you! So I luckily I have 3 untattooed fingers and found this amazing device! The information is detailed and gives you explanations as to what your scores mean and how you should conduct yourself for the day based on sleep data and how active you have been and are in general. I love that it has access to meditation and relaxing apps as well and prompts to get you moving if you've been sat chilling for just a bit too long.I received this as a gift for Christmas, I got the actual ring the first week of January after trying out the sizes, so have had enough time using it. Ordering the ring after paying was a bit strange, as I was given a weird number to call and it didnt seem legit, but reading through the comments they are a relatively new company and still working out the kinks (this has nothing to do with the quality of the ring itself). I'm going to throw it out there too, we are in pandemic guys!If you're looking for a way to track your health and keep you motivated, this is the product you need. Its lightweight, fairly decent to look at and I forget it's on! I'm a barista so constantly washing hands and using them, ring is going fine! Battery life is also fine, just make sure you charge it...the app lets you know when its low. All in all, great product and will definitely be sticking with it :-)",5,2021-02-03T09:07:22.000Z,Sarah,GB,12.0
Dodgy battery life,"Bought the ring, massive investment for me but thought it would be quality with a two year warranty. Loved it so much at the beginning, until I started missing nights of sleep data because the battery was dying. Turns out they're just happy to replace defunct rings until your warranty expires.. my first lasted a little over a year before the battery went, took ages to get the second, it finally arrived and lasted about 5 months before the battery was twice as bad as the original one. However, it had just clocked over the 2 year warranty, so the only compensation offered was the stock standard ""save $50 to upgrade"".. as if I'd be up for round three of battery fails on an expensive product. I'm now left with a ring that needs to sit on its dock to charge every day, and is degrading at a rate that in about a month it probably won't even last the night on a full battery.

Worthless return policy and appalling customer service,"If you are going to buy an Oura ring, please be very sure that you want it as the return procedure is not very straight forward and to be honest, thus far for me, worthless.

I’ve gone back to them with a question and it has been radio silence - absolutely no one has answered my question despite following up twice. The window for the return is running out. This is just not acceptable.The process for returning the ring from Australia is near to impossible. I have been advised by UPS that to return it and charge Oura like Oura have asked me to, I actually need to setup a business account with them which involves, ID, credit checks and a lengthy approval process. UPS have advised that it is possible for Oura to generate a return label and email it to me. I have asked Oura via email for a return label and heard absolutely nothing back.

I found someone to complain to and they sent me a ring in a plastic bag with no charger and no instructions and the wrong colour.  I love the ring I purchased earlier this year but my goodness what has happened?  Customer service is virtually non existent: no number to call - you may be lucky to get some kind of response in 3 weeks  is email but it is usually just sending you back to Frequently asked questions.  I have never seen a company with a good product fail at everything else.,1,2020-12-29T05:28:58.000Z,Gillian Bennett,MX,4.0
Horrible customer service,I ordered a ring(4 weeks ago) and I did not know I had to pay importation fees. I've emailed a bunch of times(4 times) to request a refund that to have the company ask UPS to return it to sender but no one ever gets back to me. To me this is just ridiculous. Why does no one ever get back to the support claims I file. The customer service is really just terrible at this point. This was supposed to be a christmas gift. Now i dont a gift and i also dont have the money to buy another gift. Don't waste your money and time.,1,2020-12-24T15:07:43.000Z,Christian Lubin,US,1.0

DON'T BUY FAULTY PRODUCT,"As with everyone else, I have also had serious problems with customer support at Oura Ring. My ring stopped working well over two weeks ago. I had to file numerous support tickets just to get someone to respond. When they finally did, several days later, they said a warranty team member would look into the issue within 1-2 days. Well, 12 days later, and numerous other support tickets and messages I have sent, I still haven't got even a single reply (in fact, some of the newer support tickets were just closed so I know someone at least saw them). It also doesn't help that my ability to file tickets in the app has now been removed. I have had my ring for just over a year, so it should be covered, but at the rate things are going, I doubt I will ever hear from the warranty team. For anyone considering the Oura ring, I would strongly recommend going with another product. The pain and issues you will deal with customer support are just not worth the cost and few benefits the ring actually gives you vs competitor products.",1,2020-12-12T15:44:54.000Z,Zack Keim,US,1.0

Amazing Sleep Tracking technology,"Amazing Sleep Tracking technology!  I used to have the Basis sleep tracker watch before it got pulled from the market because some people had gotten skin burns from the high level temperature tracking it did, which was a real bummer, considering it really worked to track deep sleep and REM not, just the amount of sleep.  Thankfully, Ouraring is able to also measure skin temp. and use the same type of formulation to really track your deep sleep very accurately and with an easier to sleep with device.  I don't even use it for cardio fitness tracking, since my apple phone and watch can do that just fine.   I have had no glitches and it works more reliably than any other technology I have used recently.  I have submerged it in water many times with no isssues.

Before you get this ring...,"Before you get this ring, consider the following: Oura recommends that you ""upsize"" when purchasing.

It doesn't track much info during the day, has no sleep-synced alarm (shout out to the Sleep cycle app- my best subscription), and just becomes a ""is this $300 still on my finger"" hazard.

"Defective ring, Oura won’t replace","My ring doesn’t function correctly. It consistently over-reports activity by at least 900%. When I reached out to Oura, they told me that I was mistaken and actually DO move that much. I am a severely disabled person and am familiar enough with my illness to know that I am NOT reaching those activity levels by laying flat on my back and texting. Then they told me I must have some kind of “vibration” near my hands all day. These scenarios are ludicrous. Either Oura is useless as an activity tracker, or I have a defective ring. Regardless, this is one of the worst product experiences I’ve ever had. If it can’t even get simple activity tracking right, is any of the data correct?

Too many issues to recommend,"First, I want to start off by saying that I love what they are attempting to do here with this ring and I love this product when it works. The issue unfortunately is that the battery seems to work great for 7 months (6-7 days per charge) and then goes off a cliff and needs to be charged daily. I have had this happen to two rings at almost 7 months to the day. The first one was replaced via warranty with very little trouble. My latest one unfortunately has taken weeks and DHL has either lost the package or delivered it to the wrong address and Oura is not responding to my emails. There is also no way to get in touch with them by phone. My ring will also not charge past 1 percent at this point so its essentially dead. This is not acceptable for a product that costs much more than its competitors. I want to recommend this product as I would love for them to fix this ring however, the clear hardware issues coupled with the lack of response and the fact that this is a company that’s just not set up to do business in the U.S. makes it impossible to recommend for 300-400 dollars.

At the end of the ordeal, the second rep apologised for the poor service but didn't mention any steps they would take to improve transparency and stop messing customers around in the future so it feels hollow.I regret buying my ring and feel completely mugged off by the support process.

I understand things are difficult at the moment but I would really like to get this sorted ASAP as the price of the ring is extremely high especially when it doesn’t work.",1,2020-05-29T05:34:35.000Z,Mary,GB,2.0

I emailed their support team, no response. I tried to reach them again in a few days, they ignored me again. I received the order with wrong size and decided to return since they never replied my emails, only when I said I’m returning it.

Too difficult to get a hold of someone through their contact form,"I ordered my ring 11 days ago and I’ve yet to receive a sizing kit. I tried contacting OURA multiple times to at least get a status of my order. I contacted them through their support form, Twitter, Facebook messenger and no response. I’ve sent them emails and tracked each one to see if it was opened (I was able to see when they opened the emails) they read them and completely ignored me. I have been polite in my emails but I’m loosing my patience. This is the worst customer service I’ve ever had to deal with. It would be nice to hear an explanation why it’s so difficult for them to simply respond. Are they short staffed, do they just not care? What is the deal???UPDATE: They responded after messaging them through Instagram, Facebook messenger and Twitter. The sizing kit finally arrived about a week later.

So on their website they say how they ship the sizing kit within 1 day, what they leave out is it takes 2 WEEKS TO GET TO YOU. Nice. After waiting two weeks for a sizing kit, i found my size and followed the directions. Now, you would expect they could get something as basic as confirming your size down. Nope. I am now stuck in an endless loop of going to the my order page to confirm the size, entering in my email i used to order, in which they send me a new email that says ""get started"" and that links me back to the order page in which it asks for the email i used to order so they can send the confirmation email and that endlessly loops. I order a ton of stuff online, but never have i seen such sneaky and terrible customer service practices until i discovered Oura. Oh yeah, and when i finally get help from the customer service say in 2-7 days, i am informed the ring actually comes from the netherlands. So it will be another 2 weeks.

NO followup confirmation that the trouble ticket was received, no followup suggestions or help.  AVOID this ring - it is kind of neat at first.

"Great device, huge potential, highly recommended",As a physician I think this device has tremendous potential not only from an athletic performance Sandpoint but also from a general health perspective such as monitoring chronic disease states. I’ve been wearing the ring for a couple of weeks and also the Whoop 3.0 strap for a few months. I find that the ring is probably considerably more accurate and its measurements and after listening to a few lengthy interviews on YouTube with one of the chief officers of the company I think their goals and ability to achieve those goals are high. I agree that their customer service leaves something to be desired but I have no doubt that will be a core focus in the next few months.I wish that they would cite some of their medical references for my journal perspective on the website.

"Great app, but highly inaccurate data and very bad customer service","Positive+ I love the app: great, intuitive interface with a lot of interesting data+ Ring design: I like the look, and it is comfortable to wear 24/7+ Good battery lifeNegative- I was very disappointed when I realised, after using the ring for 5 weeks, that the recorded data is very inaccurate:-- It thinks I sleep when I watch TV in the evening-- It has established that my base calorie burn without exercise is 1600kcal - I loose weight pretty rapidly with that amount of daily calories (i.e. even without exercise when the total calorie consumption is obviously higher)-- Its walking equivalency is even 50% off. For a bit less than a 5km walk it gives 10km. The number of steps is equally inaccurate.- It is supposed to capture ""restful moments"" during the day, but even if I take a 45min nap (and sleep properly), it doesn't get recorded- Beware that if you do exercise such that your hands are stable (e.g. using an exercise bike), it doesn't get recorded. This is by design. You can add activities manually, though.- Customer service is almost non-existent. They don't seem to have a contact number and if they answer your email, it takes several weeks.Having said all that, after 5 weeks I'm still using the product.

After about 3 weeks, the ship date slipped first by 1 week, then by 2, and now my original ship date of 6/14 has moved to 7/19, a total of 5 additional weeks.  Customer support took more than a week to reply to my question about the slip and I was given some 'batches' hand-waving (apparently they do not keep _any_ stock).  I was charged at the time of ordering which, contrary to Oura's claims, is not standard e-commerce practice (at least not in the USA).Furthermore, their shipping update page clearly states at the top that they update every week, but it really is more like every 2 weeks.  Asking about that got me a boilerplate reply about how busy they are, again with a long delay before answering.Reviews from people who actually have the ring seem good, but I can't confirm them.

Arnaque entreprise Circular sur Kickstarter,"Circular a lancé une campagne de financement à travers Kickstarter pour un nouvel anneau nommé circular 2 en mars 2025.

Lors d un déroulé de la campagne 2 objectifs (""goals"") ont été atteints, débloquant ainsi 2 fonctionnalités supplémentaires (suivi pression artérielle et suivi du glucose). Ces fonctions de suivi, étant des fonctions très intéressantes pour leurs utilisateurs, sont de puissants arguments commerciaux afin de que la campagne puisse attirer un maximum de contributeurs.

Une trahison à la hauteur de votre silence,"Je fais partie des contributeurs de la première heure, ceux qui ont cru en votre vision, qui ont investi non seulement de l’argent, mais de la confiance. En retour, nous avons eu droit à quoi ? À une volte-face commerciale honteuse, à des promesses piétinées, et maintenant — cerise sur le gâteau — à la censure pure et simple.

Vos engagements initiaux incluaient des fonctionnalités de santé ambitieuses (pression artérielle, glycémie…) intégrées dans le produit. Aujourd’hui, vous les transformez en options payantes, sans avertissement, sans discussion, et surtout sans respect. Ce n’est pas un changement de cap, c’est une escroquerie à peine déguisée.

Et plutôt que d’ouvrir le dialogue, vous avez choisi la voie la plus lâche : supprimer les commentaires critiques et bloquer ceux qui osent exprimer leur déception. Un mépris total de votre communauté. Vous ne supportez pas la transparence ? Ou est-ce la vérité qui vous dérange ?

À ceux qui vous rejoindraient demain : fuyez. Car derrière les paillettes marketing se cache une réalité bien plus sombre : une équipe qui renie ses promesses, méprise ses soutiens, et efface les traces de ses propres renoncements.

Ne voyant rien arriver, le support m'a dit qu'il faudrait que j'attende 3 mois pour la recevoir... J'ai demandé alors un remboursement. Remboursement que j'attends toujours depuis plus d'1 mois maintenant malgré de multiples relances et qu'il a fallu que je demande via PayPal car la procédure standard n'a pas marché.

À fuir de toute urgence,"À fuir de toute urgence ! J’ai repéré cette entreprise dans la célèbre émission de M6. Le concept et le produit m’ont vraiment emballée. J’ai attendu longtemps qu’ils se développent Et mettent en vente la bague. J’y croyais vraiment beaucoup. J’ai donc fait l’achat de ma bague en novembre 2022 pour une livraison prévue en mai 2023. Les choses ont de suite mal commencé, sachant que ma bague a été livrée avec plus de six mois de retard. La taille n’était pas bonne en plus, car entre deux tailles, Je l’ai perdue. J’en ai donc rachetée une autre, Encore une fois en leur faisant confiance. Et depuis ce jour, le cauchemar. Je n’ai eu que des soucis. Le prix de la bague déjà conséquent, et j’avais acheté en plus la garantie exprès. Quand ce n’était pas la bague qui ne se synchronise plus avec l’application, C’était des problèmes de fonctionnement et de mesure des informations de santé ( un peu le but principal ) , Bref, il y avait toujours des problèmes. Et cela mettait des semaines à être résolu. En tout, on m’a changé quatre fois la bague, et à chaque fois il y a eu des problèmes et elles ne fonctionnait plus, je crois que je l’ai utilisé au maximum un mois consécutif . Entre le service client et les 25 opérateurs différents auquel l’on a affaire et qui répondent chacun une version différente, c’est la catastrophe. Je demande un remboursement car j’en ai plus qu’assez d’avoir payé presque 300 € pour un produit que je ne peux pas utiliser, On me répond qu’ils sont prêts à m’envoyer le nouveau prototype de la bague en me faisant un rabais, mais que je dois rajouter 100 € de ma poche le comble !!! Je leur maintiens que je veux un remboursement, Cela fait plus d’un mois que ça dure, et je n’ai toujours pas été remboursée. Ils essayent de gagner du temps, ils me sortent toutes les excuses du monde, D’abord c’est parce qu’il y a trop de demandes de remboursement en même temps, ensuite c’est parce que si ensuite c’est parce que ça.. On m’a promis un remboursement au 26 décembre 2024 maximum. Je sens gros comme une maison que je ne l’aurais pas d’ici là. On m’écrit pour me demander une demande de remboursement PayPal alors que j’ai payé par carte bancaire. J’ai quand même fait une demande de remboursement PayPal pour le montant entier auquel j’ai acheté la bague et j’attends toujours à ce jour… C’est une honte !! Bref produit, déplorable, service client déplorable, si je n’ai pas mon remboursement rapidement, je saisis la justice et les associations de consommateur et j’irai jusqu’au bout.

Grosse déception pour une bague connectéee connectée Circular…,"J'ai acheté la bague connectée Circular en pensant trouver un produit high-tech moderne et pratique. Mais dès l'installation, la déception est au rendez-vous. Le logiciel est visiblement pensé pour un écran de PC : sur smartphone, tout est minuscule, illisible, et cliquer devient un parcours du combattant. L’interface semble tout droit sortie des années 90, avec des adresses MAC et des noms internes compliqués, tout sauf convivial. En plus, l'application fait des erreurs à répétition, rendant son utilisation encore plus frustrante.

Comme si cela ne suffisait pas, mon chargeur est tombé en panne après seulement deux jours. Au lieu de simplement le remplacer, le service client complique les choses pour une pièce qui vaut à peine 50 centimes.

Une qualité médiocre et un support inimaginable,"Ce sera donc mon second message sur une expérience totalement incroyable pour une startup qui se veut différente ...
Commande en août, premier dysfonctionnement après 10 jours, changement de la bague après de multiples échanges, réception en septembre, second dysfonctionnement 2 mois après, et le sketch recommence.
On me demande plusieurs choses, des vidéos de la bague sur son chargeur (je ne vois pas l'intérêt), des tests de chargement (charge de plus de 24 heures) et alors que le problème était exactement le même que la première fois.
Une personne charmante dialogue avec moi, elle m'explique que tout se passera bien, que le remplacement est en cours, que je peux demander effectivement de changer la couleur de la bague et que je peux intégrer la liste d'attente pour la bague de seconde génération.
Je me dis alors que tout va bien et que ma première expérience d'août dernier est derrière mois.
Mais Circular reste une société incroyable car en 1 jour, tout peut changer.
Je reçois un mail ce matin, de la même personne avec qui j'avais échangée. Curieusement, elle m'écrit en anglais alors que les premiers échanges étaient en anglais.
Elle m'annonce alors ... ""En fait, je ne suis au courant de rien, le remplacement n'est pas lancé, la bague restera de toute façon en noir et blablabla."".
Je reviens donc une semaine en arrière.

J’ai donc repris mes discussions passionnantes avec le chat de Circular, et toujours cette capacité à tourner en rond et que tout sera résolu rapidement. C’était le 22 août.
Nous sommes maintenant le 29 octobre et toujours rien !
Entre temps, on m’a proposé de changer le modèle noir (en rupture de stock taille 11) contre le modèle Silver qui est disponible, pour un remplacement immédiat ! J’ai accepté cette proposition pour entendre cette semaine que le modèle Silver était disponible au moment de la proposition mais qu’elle ne l’est plus dorénavant. Et toujours aucune capacité et confirmer un quelconque délai (c’est la principale régularité de Circular : la chaîne d’approvisionnement est une boite noire qu’ils ne semblent aucunement maîtriser).
Bref, toujours aucune idée si je recevrais un jour une bague réellement fonctionnelle , ni sous quel délai.
Pour autant, on voit sur leur site que des promesses de livraison sous 2 semaines ! Quelle blague !
Je confirme donc mes avis précédents de passer son tour et d’économiser le prix conséquent d’un équipement qui n’est pas aboutit qualitativement, et auquel il n’existe aucun service client digne de ce nom.

Édit 29/10 12h : quelle rapidité de réponse de Circular ! Avec exactement le type de message qui n’apporte aucune réponse, comme c’est le cas lors de tout autre échange. Voyons quel résultat cela apporte… En tout cas, une vraie volonté de contrôler l’image projetée sur les communautés, en reconnaissant des imperfections mais en n’apportant aucun correctif.

Mieux vaut payer un peu plus pour avoir une meilleure qualité chez la concurrence,"Les avis ont été toujours mitigés, avec des arguments de vente qui sont très bons, mais dont la réalité est toute autre. J’ai un ami qui lui a la bague de chez Oura depuis 2 ans, et on a voulu comparé, du coup j’ai acheté il y a 1 mois la bague Circular Slim.

J’ai été assez déçu de mon expérience, et regrette plus qu’autre chose mon achat que je ne sais pas renvoyer vu que j’ai dépassé les 14 jours de rétractations légales. En résumé :

- Une IA intégrée qui se vend comme coach personnel, mais qui ne fait que lire nos informations pour mettre sous forme de texte. Qui plus est, souvent des erreurs de lecture, des conseils qui prennent pas en compte la réalité, ou des conseils ridicules du style « vous avez eu un sommeil agité cette nuit, vous devriez faire de la méditation ». Bah si j’ai eu un sommeil agité c’est parce qu’il faisait 28° dans ma chambre c’est tout …

- Mesures surévaluées, là où généralement c’est l’inverse. En étant à mon bureau au travail, je fais 7000 pas sur la journée… Mieux encore, au niveau des calories brûlées, je suis à 2900kcal par jour. Je me demande pourquoi je ne perds pas de poids vu que je mange moins de 2400kcal.

- Type d’activité tronqué, considère souvent que je suis en activité sportive et non en zone de stress alors que je suis juste en crise de panique. Quand je fais des siestes de 30 minutes, je suis juste dans une période calme.

- Évaluation de la qualité du sommeil subjective. Même quand j’ai passé une bonne nuit malgré le peu d’heure de sommeil, mon score est faible. Si je fais pas au minimum 9h de sommeil comme j’ai indiqué dans mon idéal de vie, mon score est faible …

- des conseils par notification sur les bonnes périodes pour faire telle ou telle chose. Honnêtement, autant ne rien dire parce que ça se base sur rien du tout. Me proposer des activités mentales à 22:30, on repassera.

- synchronisation des données très lentes. Mais alors, très très lente. En moyenne, j’ai chronométré, avec 2 fois par jour (matin - soir), il faut compter près de 56 secondes.

- qualité de fabrication faible. La peinture se dégrade très vite, je vois déjà des griffes après 1 mois.

- service client, quand je demande de l’aide, on me répond assez vite. Je comprends pas les avis qui disent le contraire parce que je n’ai jamais eu de souci. En revanche, avec tous les soucis que j’ai eu, j’ai dû être beaucoup trop en contact avec eux et ça a tiré en longueur. Mon chargeur ne fonctionnait plus au bout de 4 jours. Plutôt que de simplement m’en renvoyer un autre, je devais faire des démarches et tests pendant des heures. Au final j’ai payé moi-même la livraison d’un nouveau chargeur qui m’a coûté plus de 30€ avec la livraison dont le prix est exorbitant.

Bref, niveau expérience, je suis pas convaincu du tout. Ça donne des bonnes bases, mais ne mérite pas du tout de demander un prix comme celui-ci. Même si elle est moins cher que la concurrence, si j’avais su, j’aurais donné 100€ de plus pour m’assurer de la qualité de celle-ci.",2,2024-07-27T00:05:51.000Z,Jonathan,BE,13.0

Une bague totalement inutile et absolument pas fiable,"J'ai commandé cette bague lorsqu'elle était en vente sur Kickstarter.
- La bague a mis 2 ans pour arriver (alors qu'un délai de 6 mois était annoncé).
- La synchronisation de la bague avec l'application a beaucoup de mal à se faire, en l'occurrence, les données de sommeil ne remontent que très rarement
- Les quelques rares fois ou les données du sommeil s'affichent, les données sont complètement erronées : lorsque je me réveille durant la nuit, la bague ne le détecte pas, et à contrario, lorsque je passe une nuit exceptionnelle, la bague affiche plusieurs éveils.
- Plusieurs bugs ont été rapportés au service client, mais aucun retour, et aucune prise en compte de ces bugs
- J'ai meme essayé de porter 2 bagues en meme temps sur une nuit, une bague professionnelle reconnue par le corps médical et la bague de Circular, les données sont radicalement différentes sur la très grande majortié des indicateurs (taux d'oxygène dans le sang, fréquence cardiaque...)
- Je pense meme que l'équipe de Circular est consciente qu'elle affiche du grand n'importe quoi, c'est pour ça qu'au bout de 2 ans, elle a décidé de supprimer la fonctionnalité d'analyse des différents cycle du sommeil (léger, profond, paradoxal...). Je pense que rien que cette phrase parle d'elle meme, nul besoin de rajouter tous les autres problèmes rencontrés",1,2024-07-21T12:02:43.000Z,Fred yoh,FR,2.0

J'en suis résigné à contacter les services compétents pour obtenir réparation et faire contrôler les agréments, notamment CE car une batterie gonflée après un mois semble dangereuse et difficilement conforme avec les tests de conformité.

"Pire produit, pire SAV","J'ai commandé une bague connectée chez Circular le 19/05/2023, au prix de 292,99 euros. Elle devait originellement arriver en juillet 2023. Elle a été envoyée le 22/11/2023 (!), et reçue le 28/11/2023, après que j'aie contacté une première fois le SAV le 10/10/2023. Après 10 jours d'utilisation, la bague ne fonctionnait déjà plus. J'ai donc recontacté le service client le 12/12/2023, qui m'a fait effectuer beaucoup d'opérations, y compris, le 8/03/2024, donc trois mois plus tard, d'attendre 2 à 4 jours de plus et de tenter de redémarrer la bague. Finalement, le 11/03/2024, le SAV a accepté de m'envoyer une bague de remplacement, que j'ai reçue le 15/03. Dommage, la taille n'était pas bonne. J'ai donc renvoyé, à mes frais, la bague en question. Il a été reçu par Circular le 5/04. Le 24/04, le SAV m'a garanti qu'une nouvelle bague allait m'être envoyée. Le 24/05, constatant que le colis n'avait toujours pas été envoyé, j'ai demandé un remboursement, citant les articles L. 217-4 à L. 217-14 du Code de la Consommation, et les sommant de me rembourser sous 14 jours. Le dernier message reçu du SAV date du 11/06, me garantissant que le processus de remboursement était en cours (sans pouvoir apporter de preuve concrète, ainsi que je leur ai demandé). Nous sommes aujourd'hui le 18/06, plus d'un an après mon achat, j'ai pu utiliser la bague pendant 10 jours au total sur cette période, le SAV me semble surtout tout faire pour gagner du temps. Le fil Reddit consacré à Circular et TrustPilot parlent d'eux-même, soit l'entreprise est purement incompétente à tous les niveaux, soit il s'agit très basiquement d'une arnaque.
NB: Ces pratiques ont été remontées ce jour à la DGCCRF

Edit suite à la réponse de Circular : J'ai. Exigé. Un. Remboursement.
Quant à votre affirmation comme quoi la bague de remplacement est envoyée, comme d'habitude, aucune preuve, juste du blabla (Edit: J'ai effectivement reçu un mail comme quoi mon colis était en route, dommage, je vais devoir ENCORE PAYER POUR LE RENVOYER CHEZ CIRCULAR, PARCE QUE C'EST PAS CE QUE J'AI DEMANDÉ, BANDE DE NOUILLES).
Remboursez-moi, pas de négociation. Prochaine étape c'est le conciliateur de justice. Tellement d'efforts pour compenser votre amateurisme...
(et oui la bague qui s'est perdue en chemin, bien évidemment, dommage qu'il n'y a pas un seul mail pour prouver vos dires... vous savez ""Fake it til you make it"" au bout d'un moment ça commence à se voir)

"Attention, arnaque au consommateur, pas de remplacement ou remboursement du produit défectueux.","Je suis tellement déçu par cette entreprise qui pourtant semblait prometteuse dès la plateforme de financement participatif (alors tenue par des français). Je rejoins la plupart des avis précédents. Je suis mené en bateau depuis plus de 2 ans et, croyez le ou non, 126 échanges de mails !!!
Méfiez vous vraiment, vous aurez toujours une réponse aux mails envoyés et le seul objectif de ces réponses est de vous faire espérer, de vous faire patienter, et au final... de ne rien faire.
J'ai acheté ma bague circular ring le 6 mai 2022, pour ne la recevoir qu'en juin 2023... Pensant ma patience récompensée, la bague n'a pas fonctionné plus de 10 jours, des premières pannes sont apparues dès la première semaine, cela aurait dû me mettre la puce à l'oreille, mais trop content de l'avoir enfin reçue, je me disais que les évolutions de l'app encore en version beta permettraient des améliorations (pas de chargement sur l'app, fonctionnement de la vibration aléatoire, recharge partielle...). Mais très vite, la bague présente des défauts de charge et devient inutilisable. Après de nombreux échanges avec le service client (une trentaine de mails), contacté le 22 juin 2023, ils acceptent un changement de bague. Je leur retourne donc la première bague reçue pour ne recevoir la ""nouvelle"" (qui en réalité une version beta ratée) que le 15 novembre 2023... soit 5 mois après ma demande de remplacement. Comble de l'ironie, la bague est envoyée sans chargeur (chargeur que j'achète donc sur le site, qui lui arrive en quelques jours et, à la décharge de circular, ils me le remboursent en s'excusant pour la gêne occasionnée). Mais après quelques jours d'utilisation, la bague rencontre de nouveaux problèmes, notamment de chargement justement. C'en est trop, après une nouvelle salve d'une trentaine de mails (pour me refaire faire les mêmes tests inutiles et me faire perdre mon temps 2 mois de plus), le remboursement est accepté. Je retourne donc la bague le 10 janvier 2024 (qu'ils mettent près d'un mois à récupérer, c'est moi qui ai dû contacter le service colissimo pour prouver au service client qu'ils l'avaient bien reçue). Ils me font faire une demande de remboursement par Paypal le 21 février 2024, pour me mener en bateau presque toutes les semaines en me promettant le remboursement dans les jours à venir... finalement, la demande de remboursement Paypal est annulée le 6 mai dernier (beau clin d'oeil, l'achat de la bague ayant été fait jour pour jour 2 ans auparavant). Ils me proposent de faire une nouvelle demande en m'assurant un traitement dans la semaine, puis la semaine d'après, puis la semaine d'après, puis la semaine d'après... bref, vous connaissez la suite, cela fait des mois que cela dure...
Il est intéressant de constater que sur leur page Facebook, il y a de très nombreux commentaires... non visibles 😉 Ils doivent embaucher des personnes pour simplement supprimer les commentaires négatifs qu'ils reçoivent chaque jour par centaine.
Je ne recommande donc absolument pas cette entreprise qui est certes très bonne en marketing et communication, mais absolument pas fiable côté technique, technologie et suivi client.
Je vais maintenant laisser la justice prendre la suite, car je suis épuisé par mes nombreuses relances.

- des demandes de la somme à rembourser sur PayPal annulées

Remboursement impossible ?,"J'ai commandé ma bague le 28/11/22, on me promettait un envoi au bout de 2 ou 3 mois. L'envoi a eu lieu 6 mois plus tard. Manque de chance, j'ai changé d'adresse entre temps. J'ai donc signalé auprès de Circular, qui prend bien en compte l'information et annule l'envoi et m'assure d'envoyer à la nouvelle adresse.
Silence radio pendant 6 nouveaux mois, je préfère donc demander l'annulation de ma commande. Ma demande est bien prise en compte, et on me promet de me rembourser plusieurs mois plus tard en me proposant une date ""ferme et fixe"" à laquelle Circular s'engage.
Cette fameuse date arrive, aucun remboursement. Je relance deux semaines plus tard, laissant un temps à l'entreprise, au cas où certains problèmes subsistent, toujours pas de remboursement mais un message d'excuse.
Je relance alors une dernière fois, le 18 mai 2024, cette fois en mettant en demeure l'entreprise de me rembourser avec un délai d'une semaine, mais rien non plus...
Résultat, j'attends toujours le remboursement. J'ai remarqué qu'en passant par TrustPilot, certains mécontents ont eu résultat de cause, alors je tente ici : veuillez me rembourser !",1,2024-05-24T18:10:17.000Z,Sebastien P,FR,1.0

Le pire achat de ma vie,"J'ai acheté la Circular Ring Slim pour deux raisons principales : le suivi du sommeil et le fait que ce soit une boite française.
C'est tout simplement la pire expérience d'objets high tech que j'ai eu jusqu'à présent. Déjà, les délais de livraison sont monstrueux et dès la réception, j'ai été déçue car la bague a des aspérités et défauts de fabrication. C'est moche pour un objet qui est censé être porté comme un bijou. On voit même des traces de colle au niveau du capteur, je me demande comment ça peut fonctionner correctement avec ces traces d'ailleurs...
Ensuite, après seulement 3 jours elle ne fonctionnait déjà plus (elle ne vibrait plus et ne voulait plus se connecter à l'app). J'ai contacté le service client et là surprise on me répond en anglais... Super, je choisis une boite française et le service client ne réponds pas dans ma langue. Heureusement que je parle anglais. Les échanges ont été interminables à vouloir me faire faire des manipulations qui ne fonctionnaient pas (je sais lire une FAQ...) Pour finalement me dire que le problème est plus technique et sera remonté plus haut. En parallèle, j'ai laissé la bague se décharger complètement et j'ai supprimé mon compte et recréé un nouveau et là par magie, ça a refonctionné.
Sauf qu'en réalité les données remontées par la bague sont totalement fausses. ça ne correspond pas du tout à ce que mon Apple Watch remonte et pour le sommeil, raison principale de l'achat, c'est n'importe quoi. Je fais des insomnies et je me réveille souvent au milieu de la nuit pendant plusieurs heures. La bague, elle, me dit que je dormais à ce moment là.
Je suis extrêmement déçue, moi qui voulait donner une chance à une marque Française, j'aurais mieux fait de prendre une Oura Ring.
Ayant la bague depuis moins de 2 semaines, je vais demander un remboursement mais au vu des différents commentaires, je n'y crois pas trop. C'est vraiment honteux.",1,2024-05-01T08:19:32.000Z,Umai Ellie,FR,4.0

Dommage,"Je viens de lire les différents avis et je vois que les problèmes remontées sont toujours plus ou moins les mêmes que ceux que je rencontre. Je suis déçue par ce produit c'est vrai. Je l'ai eu début 2024, le 13 éme jour de calibrage impossible de la synchroniser. Elle ne vibrait plus. Bref, 5 jours pour qu'elle soit de nouveau operationnelle , avec des données complétement farfelues du coup (Néanmoins pendant ce laps de temps le service client à toujours répondu, je n'ai rien à reprocher de ce côté là). moins de trois semaines après re-belote. Et depuis eh bien c'est tous les jours la surprise : parfois elle ne synchronise aucune données, les horaires de sommeil sont effectivemment souvent fausses, donc inutiles. Les graphiques ne sont pas vraiment parlant J'aime bien par contre la fonction reveil avec la vibration. A noter aussi qu'en mode performance il faut la recharger tous les jours. La mienne est déjà considérablement rayée (et je bosses derrière un écran).
J'ai choisi cette bague parce que française, mais je pense que le produit n'est pas abouti... au final je pense que je ne l'utiliserais plus très longtemps, c'est finalement devenu une contraire et une source de frustration supplementaire dans ma vie.

Que ce soit pour améliorer mon sommeil, augmenter mon niveau d'activité ou réduire mon stress, les conseils de Kira+ sont toujours pertinents et adaptés à mes besoins spécifiques. C'est comme avoir un coach personnel à portée de main, qui me guide vers un mode de vie plus sain et équilibré.

Circular ? À fuir,"Utilisation circular slim depuis 3 mois environ.

- La bague se raye facilement (je n'ai pourtant pas un métier manuel) et comme elle n'est pas teintée dans la masse, c'est moche et très visible.
- Les soirées télé sont détectées comme du sommeil, et faussent complètement les résultats.
- Les données biométriques semblent souvent farfelues.
- L'infrastructure réseau est déplorable du côté de circular, avec des latences énormes et des pannes à répétitions avec perte de données.
- Quand la bague est quasi déchargée (<10%), elle passe en mode ""mort"" et c'est la croix et la bannière pour la réveiller : compter une journée de perdue et beaucoup d'efforts pour arriver à la réveiller.
- L'autonomie est < 48h en mode performance, mode obligatoire si l'on veut surveiller son sommeil, et la recharge prends plutôt 2h30 que les 45 minutes comme annoncées.
- Bien que l'application soit en français, tous les mails sont en anglais, ce qui peut gêner beaucoup de personnes. Pourquoi ne pas adapter la langue à chaque profil utilisateur ?

Après 3 jours d'utilisation et 2 recharges (la tenue de la batterie est vraiment bien en dessous des valeurs indiquées sur le site) alors peut être du fait qu'elle soit obligatoirement en mode perf pendant 14 jours, je me rends compte qu'il y a un 10 a l'intérieur de la bague, alors que la boîte indiqué bien la taille commande soit la taille 11.

Bonjour Benjamin,

Merci de nous avoir envoyé ces photos.

Je suis terriblement navré de cette erreur.

Si la taille de votre bague ne correspond pas, vous avez deux options.

Première option : Si la bague est vraiment neuve et sans rayures, nous pouvons la changer gratuitement, vous n'aurez qu'à payer les frais de retour et de nouvel envoi. Nous vous demanderons des photos de la bague et attendrons de les recevoir avant de vous envoyer une autre taille. Vous voulez faire comme ça ?

Deuxième option : si la bague est rayée et n'est pas neuve, nous pouvons vous accorder une remise importante pour en acheter une autre, et vous pouvez offrir votre ancienne bague à quelqu'un ou la recycler comme n'importe quel produit électronique.

N'hésitez pas à nous faire savoir quelle option vous convient le mieux.

------------

Honteux !!
Pour information oui la bague est fortement marquée, rayée même après seulement 3 jours d'une utilisation normale, et je suis informaticien et pas mécanicien !!

Sans réponse positive soit du remboursement soit d'un échange par la bonne taille gratuitement je porterai plainte par voix d'avocat (je n'hésiterai pas à payer un avocat pour ne pas me laisser faire par ces pratiques commerciales honteuse)

Hello,
Même avis que tous les autres commentaires.
Bagues reçue il y a 4j, après des mois d'attente avec une date de livraison repoussée de mois en mois...
Je voulais absolument une bague connectée et Circular Ring Slim semblait la bague la plus aboutit. Et Circular une société fiable.
Quelle erreur ! Ring Slim HS 4j après l'avoir reçue.
Contact par mail service client hier, réponse d'une IA sans intérêt.
Je rempli le formulaire sur leur site, une cata, ca demande nom, prénom, commande, numéro du code bar sur la boite, je rempli le tout, valide et la j'ai des ""erreurs"" en gros il faut un ""@"" dans tous les champs ... Donc obligé de mettre mon mail dans le champs ""numéro de commande"", dans le champs ""nom/prénom"" et idem dans le champ SNU/QR code. Je ne sais meme pas si mon message est parvenue au service client.
Rien ne va sur leur site.
On peut voir ""bague étanche IPX8"" sur leur site (dans la FAQ), et IPX7 dans un mail reçu du 22mars.
Autre point, la bague est garantie 1an. Comment est ce possible puisque la garantie légale en France est de 2ans?
Adresse de la société dans les mails reçus: 34 avenue des Champs Elysées, 75008 Paris => on peut voir sur le site pappers.fr que cet établissement secondaire est fermé depuis le 03/11/2023 car déménagement, et que la société est maintenant au 78 AV DES CHAMPS ELYSEES
75008 PARIS 8 (à jour sur leur site).
Bref, on pourrait dire que c'est des détails, mais il y a une foultitude de détails de ce type, qui ne font absolument pas sérieux pour une société ""Francaise"" de cette taille...
J'espéré être totalement remboursé, de ma bague HS, qui n'a jamais vraiment fonctionnée (vibre quand elle le veut, ajout de prise de médicament dans l'appli, mais rien ne se sauvegarde, connexion bluetooth fonctionnant 1 coup sur 2, et j'en oubli surement.) mais au vu des expériences de chacun, j'ai des doutes.

J'apprécie particulièrement les fonctionnalités qu'elle offre. Je l’utilise notamment pour analyser mon activité physique au repos ou lors de mes entraînements sportifs (c.a.d : analyse de mon rythme cardiaque, calcul de mon VO2 max,..). De plus, Kira me donne de nombreuses recommendations. Enfin, j’aime beaucoup la fonctionnalité de réveil inteligent, je me réveille tous les matin en forme et plein d’énergie!

Par quoi commencer?,"L'attente de la bague a été un cauchemar, j'ai accepté l'envoi (que vous avez fait sans mon accord) uniquement parce que vous m'aviez dit que je devais attendre 16 semaines pour le remboursement, et je n'étais pas sûr que vous ayez l'argent pour me rembourser. La seule chose que fait la bague, mais pas de manière très fiable, c'est détecter le sommeil, cependant les valeurs sont très différentes de celles de mon Garmin. La fréquence cardiaque est totalement aléatoire, lors d'une ""vérification des mesures en direct"", elle affiche toujours plus ou moins les mêmes valeurs, peu importe si je m'entraîne ou si je fais une sieste sur le canapé. Jamais en dessous de 50, jamais au dessus de 90. J'ai eu plusieurs problèmes d'appairage, et il y a une semaine (4 semaines après l'avoir reçue) la bague est morte.

Aucun respect de la protection du consommateur,"(cf échanges précédents 05/02 et 12/02)

Selon la directive européenne sur les droits des consommateurs (2011/83/UE), lorsqu'un consommateur achète un produit en ligne, il dispose d'un droit de rétractation de 14 jours à compter de la réception du produit. Ce droit lui permet de renvoyer le produit sans avoir à justifier de motifs ni à payer de pénalités. Ce que j’ai fait.
Le 19/01, j’ai donc reçu un mail de confirmation de Circular : le colis était réceptionné, et je serai remboursé dans les 14 jours. C’est écrit.

Sauf que mon dossier a beau être « traité », Circular ne se conforme pas du tout à ses obligations légales. Car une fois le produit retourné, l'article 13 de la même directive indique que le vendeur est tenu de rembourser tous les paiements reçus du consommateur, y compris les frais de livraison standard, sans retard excessif et, en tout état de cause, au plus tard 14 jours à compter du jour où il est informé de la décision du consommateur de se rétracter.

Et à ce jour, 13/02, je n’ai toujours rien.

Et Circular a beau argumenter hier que « traité ne veut pas dire que l'on a toujours ce que l'on souhaite, car il y a des règles et des pratiques précises à suivre » (bon courage... c’est le comble...), rien ne les dédouane de se conformer à la Loi. Et donc d’adapter leurs pratiques à la Loi, et pas l’inverse.

Et même si ce n’est pas un forum, quelqu’un (ou Circular, qui semble plus réactif sur Trustpilot que via le service client classique) pourrait-il me communiquer les coordonnées mail du médiateur de la consommation dont dépend cette entreprise (info qui n’est selon Circular toujours pas communicable, malgré mes demandes répétées). Peut-être que cette institution saura les obliger à se conformer à leurs obligations légales.
Ou tout autre conseil (autre que les niaiseries stéréotypées du SAV)

Et pour info, toujours la commande 2109658059.

15/02: alors, Circular, vous avez effacé votre réponse d'hier ? Vous avez contacté un juriste de votre boite qui vous a remis la tête à l'endroit, et vous a expliqué que même dans la start-up nation, vous devez vous conformer à vos obligations légales ???
Donc je réitère ma question, qui n'a au final pas eu de réponse: quelles sont les coordonnées du médiateur de la consommation dont dépend votre entreprise ?
Je vous rappelle, s'il en était besoin, que la Directive 2013/11/UE, l'article L.611-1 du Code de la consommation (France) et l'ordonnance n° 2015-1033 du 20 août 2015 et Décret n° 2015-1382 du 30 octobre 2015 (France) IMPOSENT aux vendeurs en ligne de communiquer les coordonnées du médiateur de la consommation.

Ensuite, la temporalité du recours me regarde.
Je gèrerai sans vos ""conseils"".

19/02/2024
Je confirme le remboursement effectué ce jour. Je confirme aussi tous mes écrits précédents, les écarts volontaires et réitérés de cette entreprise envers ses obligations commerciales légales.
Je vais conseiller à mes proches, eux aussi en difficultés de remboursement, de venir les détailler sur cette plateforme… seule à même faut-il croire capable de faire au final et tardivement, changer votre attitude.",1,2024-02-19T16:33:32.000Z,Leboncoin COPAGABEN,FR,5.0

Produit inexistant,"Depuis bientôt six mois, je suis dans l'attente d'une hypothétique livraison. J'ai commandé en septembre la première version de la bague (avant qu'elle soit renommée en modèle Pro depuis l'arrivée de la version Slim... que l'on m'a aussi proposé d'acquérir à prix réduit, la bonne blague). Lors de ma commande, il était précisé que les livraisons auraient lieu en novembre. J'ai hésité, et dommage que je n'ai pas découvert avant les avis de clients arnaqués, sur ce site, cela m'aurait évité de l'être à mon tour. Cette société, présentée comme française, avec une des soi-disant meilleures expériences de bagues santé connectées, n'est pas sérieuse. Elle vend des produits qu'elle n'a pas en stock ou pas encore fabriqué, et propose régulièrement des ventes qui durent quelques jours, je suppose lorsque le cash commence à manquer dans les caisses, et elle n'envoie jamais les articles. N’y a-t-il pas moyen de déposer une plainte collective contre ce type de pratique ? C’est quand même plus de 300 euros la bague. Vraiment lamentable.",1,2024-02-03T13:32:21.000Z,Manu,FR,2.0

Peu professionnel . Une anarque ?,"Bague commandée depuis un an. Des retours (chat) quand question posée , mais une date de livraison sans cesse repoussée . Si à la dernière date donnée la bague n est pas livrée : demande de remboursement",1,2023-05-26T21:26:12.000Z,philippe ridoux,FR,1.0
Incapacité de livrer,Commandé un anneau en juin 2022 et toujours pas livré. Les délais n'arrêtent pas d'être repoussés. Les réponses de leur support sont préformatées et irrespectueuses de leurs clients. J'ai demandé un remboursement.,1,2023-05-10T19:16:00.000Z,Dtag Dtag,FR,1.0
Arnaque!,"Arnaque!
Le 30/03/2022 j'ai commandé et payé les modèles pour la taille (13€99). Après les avoir reçus j'ai commandé (cde1958690335) et payé le modèle définitif le 10/06/2022 (267€99). Je n'ai toujours rien reçu. Lorsque je demande des informations je n'obtiens aucune réponse! J'ai été arnaqué de 281€98.
A fuir
J'ai effectivement été livré, mais le 15/08/2023 (soit 1,5 ans plus tard). La bague reçue ne fonctionnait pas. Après bien des tractations on m'a promis de me livrer une bague nouvelle version courant janvier 2023! Il reste 15 jours. Wait and see",1,2024-01-16T16:18:58.000Z,Alain Kirstetter,FR,21.0
Rien recu alors que la commande date du 27/02/2022,"Comme beaucoup j'ai l'impression, toujours rien reçu alors que j'ai commandé ma bague le 27/02/2022 !!!

Aucune communication, aucune réponse aux demandes ...
Un Tchat sur le site qui ne sert à rien ...

Aucun moyen de demander un remboursement ...
Fuyez !!!!!",1,2023-03-17T19:05:51.000Z,NF,FR,5.0
