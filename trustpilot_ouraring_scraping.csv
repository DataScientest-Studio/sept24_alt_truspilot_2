I refer to my Oura app multiple times a day to review the data, the sleep data I find particularly helpful.

"Sizing kit arrived, but ring is MIA and no one cares.","Sizing kit arrived, confirmed my ring, it shipped, and then nothing. For a while, once the ring shipped it was staying in the destination state with no movement. I asked the carrier what was up, so then for some inexplicable reason they put it on a plane to a state 1200 miles from mine. The delivery got delayed. Carrier is no help as none of their reps speak English too well. So, I reached out to Oura stating I would be requesting a refund and, if the ring never arrived, initiating a chargeback. At first, I managed to get past the AI bodyguard and reach a live person. The live person, Joy, said I had to wait 5 days for a package that plainly won't show up since I just have a yellow delivery updated on my package tracking (Fedex is a mistake, guys). She didn't seem to care I am out $500 on this thing. So, I checked with the AI bot last night, couldn't figure out how to slip the bodyguard to get a human, and the AI just said to buy a new one and send this one back when it shows up. I told the dumb robot it is not showing up, hence the issue. Oura won't contact the carrier to reroute my package. I finally got fed up and got a replacement from Target. I'll initiate a chargeback from Oura when they don't refund me for their mistake of using Fedex of all America's carriers to deliver things.I am worried someone stole it. If it truly doesn't show up, I'll have to file a police report but not sure how that will go in another state... in any case, all I want is my money back at this point. Target at least will get me my product AND they have phone numbers you can call to talk to people! What a novel concept, having phone support. I did give 2 stars because, hey, at least they got me my sizing kit.","2","2025-08-02T19:01:41.000Z","KG","US","3.0"

It was down to once a day I had to charge it. They worked with me diligently I’m professionallyin the end. They swapped it out and sent me another ring. No charge. You can’t do better than that I highly recommend the company and their products.

"Great at first then totally unusable, don't waste your money","I bought my Oura 5 years ago.  After 2 years I stared having issues.  I flagged them with customer care,  was told to factory reset etc which I did.  More issues followed in my third year with it,  the battery life was getting really poor.  I flagged this and was told it wasn no longer under warranty.  Their only workaround was to offer me a discount for a newer model that was still expensive even after the discount.  Very disappointing given the price I originally paid.  I couldn't afford another one so have continued to use it until recently, when it's completely stopped functioning.  The battery life was down to needing a charge daily, now it just doesn't work.  Whilst I enjoyed my first couple of years with this and used to recommend them to everyone,  I would suggest you stay well away from them now I know how they are longer term as it's a lot of money for something that breaks that relatively quickly.  Hopefully there are some other more sustainable options out there now.","1","2025-08-01T08:59:50.000Z","Rachel","GB","5.0"

"Battery failed after 8 months — warranty honored after some persistence","I bought my Oura Ring from one of their retailers in the UK and after just 8 months the battery started draining rapidly. I contacted Oura support for a warranty replacement, but they insisted on a receipt, one I no longer had. Since the ring was bought in the UK, I pointed out that under UK consumer law a receipt isn’t required, any valid proof of purchase should be accepted such as a bank statement or the original box. After a bit of back and forth, they finally agreed and replaced the ring under warranty. If you’re in the UK and lose your receipt, know that you still have rights!","1","2025-07-29T23:13:56.000Z","Julia","SE","1.0"

They remotely diagnosed the issue and quickly confirmed it was a hardware problem. Without friction, they offered a replacement ring and managed the whole process with speed and professionalism.

"Life-changing health insight tool","I’ve been using the Oura Ring for a few days now and it has completely transformed how I understand and manage my health.

The app interface is beautiful and easy to use, and the insights are truly helpful—not just data for data’s sake.

Highly recommend for anyone serious about wellness and optimizing their lifestyle.","5","2025-07-25T20:46:16.000Z","Andressa Leslie","US","1.0"

"Save your money","I have had an Oura ring for one year, and it has already died and stopped working completely. After some research, I have found that many Oura rings do not work after a little over a year. When confronted with this problem, Oura refuses to send a new ring and only provides a $50 discount to buy a new $500 ring. I had the 3 year warranty, and was still asked to pay for part of a new ring (because I had the gold option) when it should be completely covered. Oura rings are a waste of money and do not work after a year. I would save your money and get a different tracking product for your health, because you will have to buy a new Oura ring every year or so.","1","2025-07-24T19:35:28.000Z","Tara Prendeville","US","1.0"

"Overpriced and Disappointing Durability","Overpriced and Disappointing DurabilityWhile the app is well-designed and easy to use, the overall product falls short in a few key areas. The ring material scratches far too easily — mine already has visible scratches after just six months of use. For a high-end wearable that's meant to last several years, this level of fragility is disappointing.Additionally, the data tracking seems inconsistent. Even after a poor night’s sleep, I still receive unusually high readiness scores, which makes me question the accuracy of the metrics.Given the combination of questionable data reliability and subpar material quality, I don’t believe the product justifies its high price. It feels overpriced for what it offers, both in terms of service and build.","2","2025-07-22T13:08:04.000Z","João F","PT","2.0"
"Rip-off software - Look at alternatives without subscription","The hardware is good but the software is a rip-off. If you're on the free plan you get three data points. Three! After spending hundreds of pounds they give you the most basic of information. It doesn't even tell you the number of hours sleep you've had. You have to pay for them to surface the data and whilst it is compelling and granular, the cost per month is ridiculous just to press a button as the ring is always collecting the data. For the same amount of money, I get Amazon Prime, which is free next-day delivery and a full TV streaming service. It's not like you get loads of new stuff either for your money. In the 4 months I paid for the subscription zero new features were added. I think they need to be much clearer to customers - our free plan is rubbish, so if you're buying an Oura product, be prepared to pay a subscription for life. I won't be sticking with Oura when my current Oura hardware is looking old and tired. Terrible company trying to squeeze every penny they can from customers.","1","2025-07-22T12:11:25.000Z","Daniel Jennings","GB","4.0"

"I have had an Oura Ring for…","I have had an Oura Ring for approximately 4 years now. I initially got it to improve my fitness and to pair with another app to easily record my basal temperature. However, I have been enjoying more than just those features. My ring and the app help me track my sleep, my heart rate, my food, my stress, etc. I've even used it as a sleep aid since there is a meditation feature on the app. Recently, my original ring that I bought was no longer charging and so I contacted customer service. They were incredibly prompt with a response to resolve the issue by sending me a new ring and taking a month off for my membership payment. Mind you, I was past my warranty so I was shocked with the offer to replace the ring with one that had been reset. What's more, the replacement was free! They had offered me a chance to upgrade my ring to their latest version for a discount, but I didn't mind the latter. Within 3 days of reporting the issue, I received my new ring and I'm back at it. I've never experienced such great customer service! Because of that and the features, I will continue to choose Oura over other biometric ring companies.

"Misleading, Dysfunctional, and Will Be Reported","If you’re considering Oura, save yourself the headache. This product does not work as advertised, and customer service is dismissive and unhelpful. If you paid with your FSA/HSA (as I did and many others do), read this before you waste your funds on a “medical” device that fails at basic features.I bought Oura specifically for wellness and meditation tracking. It has repeatedly failed to detect meditation sessions, app crashes are routine, and every attempt to follow their instructions results in the same outcome: NOTHING works as promised. This is a systemic, well-documented problem—search any forum or reviews.Oura’s “support” is nothing more than automated scripts blaming the user. I did everything by the book—phone connected, app running, airplane mode off, app not force-closed—and still the same bugs. When I pushed for accountability, I was met with a patronizing lecture about “professional language,” as if a frustrated, paying customer isn’t allowed to express real anger after being scammed out of their money.For the record: Using profanity out of frustration is not “harassment.” It’s protected speech, and customer service reps are not legally entitled to refuse service simply because a customer is upset—especially after wasting over $3,600 on rings and annual memberships for myself and all 5 of my close family believing their false advertising. No one used hate speech or targeted abuse. I used adult language to express valid anger at a broken product and a dismissive company.I paid using my HSA/FSA because Oura claims to be a “health device.” That means you are accountable to:	•	FTC (Federal Trade Commission) for false advertising and deceptive practices	•	FDA (if your marketing crosses the line into regulated medical device claims)	•	State Attorney General (for consumer fraud—especially with HSA/FSA purchases)	•	Better Business Bureau	•	Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)	•	Insurance plan administrators who approve Oura for HSA/FSA funds	•	Every review and complaint site I can find (Trustpilot, Reddit, BBB, and more)I am reporting this product for failing to deliver advertised functionality, for misleading health claims, and for hostile, unhelpful customer support that places blame on the customer. If enough people do the same, Oura will be forced to answer for these practices—legally and financially.Final Warning to Others:Do not waste your FSA/HSA funds or your hard-earned money on Oura. They will take your money, sell you a broken promise, and hide behind condescending customer service scripts when it fails. There are many better options for wearables that are more affordable. If you’ve been similarly wronged, file complaints with every agency above and do not let them silence you because you dared to use strong language out of justified frustration.","1","2025-07-18T09:56:33.000Z","Sarai De Leon","","3.0"

"It CROAKS in 18 months","Oh, I’ve had the ring since September 2022 — a whirlwind romance, really. We even had a little hiccup with the first one: had to exchange it because the battery gave up on life. I thought, eh can  happen. The second one on my finger since Jan '24. After a few months, the battery life dropped to under 5 days. Not great, but I’m easygoing, I rolled with it.Fast forward 18 months to today and now we’re talking full-on battery apocalypse — dead in under 10 hours. Impressive, really. So, I did what any hopeful user would do: spent two delightful hours playing chat roulette with various support agents. Each time I dared to switch to the app for basic info? Poof! Chat gone. Start over. Rinse, repeat.Eventually, the grand reveal: “Your warranty’s expired, but out of the sheer kindness of our algorithmic hearts, we’ll give you a refurbished ring!” Ah yes, the generous corporate benevolence — because, let’s be honest, without a warranty, you normally get diddly-squat. But hey, a second-hand replacement still lets them siphon off juicy health data to sell to Big Pharma while keeping that sweet subscription money flowing.And the cherry on top? Nowhere — nowhere — did it say the ring comes with an expiration date shorter than a carton of oat milk. If you just said upfront, “Hey, this ring’s gonna croak in 18 months,” fine! That would’ve been my choice. But instead, I get to feel like I’ve been tricked by a piece of jewelry with commitment issues.Honestly… shame on you.","1","2025-07-17T11:14:52.000Z","Alex de Mare","NL","3.0"
"Have had my Gen4 ring about a week and…nighttime flashing lights must be fixed","Have had my Gen4 ring about a week and am impressed with the technology and range of metrics tracked. However, the flashing lights for the sleep readings are ridiculous, especially as Oura recommends reducing light to help you sleep! I first turned off the red flashing blood oxygen monitor, to find  slerp cycles are tracked with green flashing lights. I’m a side sleeper who often has her hand on the pillow next to my head. So my night’s sleep has gotten progressively worse over the past week—41 last night all down to the ring. Finally took it off at about 3 a.m. and fell into a deep sleep until 5:40.

"Absolutely love my Oura Ring Gen 4 – a game‑changer for health!","I’ve been wearing the Oura Ring Gen 4 for several months now, and honestly — it’s been life‑changing. Not just a gadget, but a quiet, insightful companion that helps me understand myself better every day.It’s incredibly light and comfortable — I often forget I’m wearing it. Yet the data it gives me is so powerful. I love how it shows me when I’m truly recovering and when I’m under stress, even if I don’t consciously feel it. One of the coolest things I’ve noticed is how playing with my kids actually puts me into a restorative state. I would have never realized how much those moments recharge me without Oura showing me.The sleep insights are amazing — I’ve started making better choices just to protect my sleep and feel more energized. The readiness score is spot‑on: when it tells me to take it easy, I usually already feel that in my body, and when it says I’m ready to push, it gives me confidence to go for it.I also love how discreet it is — no notifications, no distractions, just clear, meaningful feedback when I open the app.There is a membership fee, but for me it’s worth every cent. The awareness it’s given me — about my stress, my sleep, my recovery, even how my body responds to different activities — is invaluable.If you care about your health and want a deeper connection to your body, I couldn’t recommend Oura more highly. Playing with my kids, taking care of myself, even knowing when to slow down — Oura has made me better at all of it.Five stars, no doubt!","5","2025-07-13T17:53:14.000Z","Tomáš Michálek","CZ","2.0"

"Why Oura Ring is a Good Choice","I have had my ring for almost a year and I have found it helpful in my journey to be more healthy. Seeing the changes in my heart rate and ability to respond to stress pushes me to see more improvement, while seeing my sleep score, readiness score and symptom radar lets me know when I need to take a day and take it easy so I don’t burn out. And I can use the data to understand what causes stress responses (good and bad), what helps me have a better night sleep, and what level of daily activity leaves me feeling my best.In the last month I noticed that my battery life was decreasing to only lasting 24 hours instead of the 6-7 days I was used to. I reached out to customer service in the app and got an immediate response. Using my email address they could see that there was an issue with the battery. Within minutes they told me a new ring would be on the way. Four days later I had a brand new ring. No hoops to jump through, no questions asked. That level of customer service is so rare to find. I would not hesitate to suggest the Oura ring to anyone who wants a better understanding of what is going on with their body.","5","2025-07-12T16:06:47.000Z","Shawna Smith","US","1.0"

The only thing they asure is that the person will not access your healthy data. Then, at july 3rd they offered me 2 options : a USD 50 discount OR to receive a refurbished ring. I didn´t have the address yet and asked how I should get in contact informing it. They said my previous conversation would be resumed as I asked for help at the app chat. So I did. They didn't find my conversation. I sent the previous request number and they said they didnt find anything. Then I sent the photo of the e-mail I received from then with the request number and finnaly they admited there was a deal to send me the refurbished ring.

The daily readiness score is a helpful reminder for self-care to maintain overall well being. My ring was always reliable and only required charging every couple of days. When the battery stop working Oura's customer service was outstanding and I was sent a replacement in a couple days (and I live in Canada). I cannot say enough about this product and company, and encourage others to wear an Oura ring whenever I get the chance!","5","2025-07-05T17:41:25.000Z","Chantal","CA","1.0"

"4 replacements since November 2024","Since my first ring purchase in November 2024 (stealth variant) we have had to have replacements over and over again with my family - my wife and our two daughters also have each a ring (also stealth - although wife’s was replaced with silver) 1. Fell apart into 3 pieces when taking off2. Heavily scratched within days of use (NO GYM OR cooking just from being an office worker)3. Developed battery issues and was notified in the app4. Again heavily scratched and battery nowhere near advertisedI am convinced the quality of their stealth rings just isn’t fit for purpose - I have a CHEAP Tapster ring to open the car and contactless payments (oura take note!) that I’ve owned for 3 years and not a single scratch!!!!Now I will preface this, that up until now, Oura staff have been empathetic and have replaced the faulty rings.Sadly, my most recent experience with a so called technical support manager (Leia) has been vastly different - not only have they made no efforts to offer a replacement of my most recent faulty ring nor would they let me pay more to try more to get a different finish as a last ditch attempt to see if the problems lie with the stealth finish.Slow to respond and uncooperative - very different to Oura’s European support staff! As a Swede, we have been proud to support our Finnish neighbours and loyal to Oura despite the monthly subscription fees and poor quality finishes.Given our last experience we will be looking to migrate the family over to Luna and/or Ultrahuman.","1","2025-06-27T08:18:46.000Z","nima azodi","SE","7.0"

"OURA - Garbage Data In Garbage Data Out Support No: 4678959","In response to linkedIn COmment about Oura being great Love seeing these comments and as a four generation user it is interesting to hear the comments. I have been communicating with Tom and others for months. about an inherent problem with OURA 4 calculating data incorrectly making all key metrics are suspect and the data outgoing ultimately flawed. It took me months for OURA to finally admit it is a known problem for many users, and they haven't chosen to focus enough resources to fix the problem, as development resources are focused elsewhere. Either a) developing other features promised to investors in their product roadmap, or b) fixing other problems they deem even more damaging. Both points give me cause for concern. It also makes me wonder how many people congratulating this announcement, either know/don't know of the problem(s), or are maybe investors themselves, and therefore somewhat biased.I eagerly look forward to a fix that has been a documented problem to Tom and others for months. I am sure they will be glad to furnish you with the documentation.A very concerned, honest, six year Oura customer. hashtag#TIME100Companies hashtag#WithOura hashtag#oura Tom Hale Chris Jones JP Underwood","1","2025-07-04T14:49:34.000Z","Michel Mercieca","US","2.0"

"Life changing device- incredible customer service","I loved my oura ring before even having to contact customer service.I bought my first Oura ring (model 4) this past November 2025. Since then, I have fully integrated it into my daily life. It has taught me more about my body than I have ever known. It has helped track my workouts, my infertility journey and sleep issues. I have recommended it to countless people (I should have made a commissions! lol)This past week (June 2025) I noticed that my battery was being drained much faster than normal. I usually can get 5+ days out of it while still using each feature to the max (recording HR workouts everyday, etc). I opened the app, found “Finn” the AI help, and simply asked him to run a diagnostic on the battery. It immediately came back with the fact that my ring was not running optimal, and a customer service rep would contact me to send me a new ring.I was skeptical, but an hour later, Anne emailed me to get my mailing information and a copy of my purchase receipt (from Best Buy) to send me a new ring.Blown away. Already have been telling all my Oura friends about this incredible customer service. Am convinced to buy my husband one for our anniversary now.","5","2025-06-22T05:16:59.000Z","Lauren Maher DiSalle","US","1.0"

"Oura Truly Cares — Exceptional Support Experience","I’ve been an Oura user for 2–3 years now and have always appreciated the product, but what impressed me most recently was their outstanding customer support.When I had a concern with heart rate and HRV tracking, I reached out to the team — and they responded with such professionalism, kindness, and attention to detail. They took my concern seriously, explained the possible causes clearly, reviewed my data thoroughly, and offered flexible solutions. I felt truly heard and supported throughout the process.Even though the Oura Ring is not a medical device, it has given me valuable insight into how my body works day to day. It helps me better understand my sleep, recovery, and overall wellbeing — and that awareness has made a real difference in how I take care of myself.Oura isn’t just about the technology; it’s about the people behind it. The care, transparency, and genuine support I’ve experienced make me proud to be a loyal customer.

"After wearing the Oura Ring for six…","After wearing the Oura Ring for six months, I can confidently say I’m very disappointed — both in the physical quality and the data it provides. I upgraded to the rose gold version, and the finish has not held up at all. It’s now scratched, tarnished, and has taken on a greenish tint — definitely not what I expected for the price point.As for the insights, they’re underwhelming. Aside from sleep tracking (which is fairly solid), the ring provides minimal meaningful feedback. My Apple Watch does a far better job with activity tracking, heart rate insights, and overall health data. The Oura Ring feels more like a trendy accessory than a true health tool.It’s being promoted as a powerful wellness tracker, but in reality, it doesn’t offer medical-grade insights or the actionable data it claims to. Unless your only interest is tracking sleep, I wouldn’t recommend it.","1","2025-06-18T19:50:42.000Z","lorien thiry","US","1.0"

"Sadly, repeated battery issues – even with replacement ring","I was initially very impressed with the Oura Ring – beautiful design, useful sleep tracking, and a well-made app. But unfortunately, the hardware quality has been disappointing.My first Gen3 ring developed serious battery issues after about a year. To Oura’s credit, they provided a replacement, and I appreciated their support at that time.However, the replacement ring has now started showing the exact same issue, again after about a year of regular use. The battery barely lasts a day, even though I’ve always followed proper charging habits (no overcharging, avoiding deep discharge, etc.).What frustrates me most is that the hardware price is way too high for this level of durability—especially since you also have to pay a monthly subscription fee on top of the expensive ring. For a premium product, I expect a much more reliable and long-lasting device.This doesn’t seem to be an isolated case either; many users report similar problems (see Reddit and other forums).The concept is great, but for this price, and with ongoing subscription costs, I sadly can no longer recommend the Oura Ring.","1","2025-06-18T09:19:08.000Z","MK","DE","1.0"
"Astounding customer service!","I can't believe the bad reviews about poor customer service - Oura has provided me with some of the best customer service I've ever experienced! The kindness and compassion they showed me has been above and beyond. I purchased my Ring 4 in December and after a very serious health issue I lost a lot of weight and my ring was unwearable because it fell off all the time. I couldn't afford to replace it and as it was 6 months old I was out of any return window. I also bought it from John Lewis and not Oura directly. However they made an exception and accepted my ring back to exchange for a smaller size. They provided the return postage label too. Oura also gave me 3 months complimentary subscription. Shout out to Lucy, Emily and Matt who provided amazing, compassionate  customer service. The Ring 4 is an amazing product. It's health tracking is so accurate and the battery lasts several days. It accurately helped me track my health metrics when I was sick which provided a lot of comfort.","5","2025-06-18T08:55:37.000Z","Sam Bomorse","GB","35.0"

"A Lifeline in a Tiny Ring","I’ve been using my Oura Ring since the end of 2019, and I can honestly say it’s been one of the most life-changing tools I’ve ever owned.With a complex mix of chronic health conditions, I used to feel completely in the dark—unsure when it was safe to push myself and when I needed to stop. The Oura Ring changed that. Its temperature tracking, heart rate monitoring, sleep analysis, and stress indicators have become a true lifeline. I now understand what my body needs, when to rest, and when I’m okay to move forward. That kind of clarity has brought a quiet peace I didn’t know I was missing.And the customer service? Absolutely phenomenal. Every time I’ve had an issue with my ring or charger, the team has gone above and beyond.

"Inaccurate Data and Customer Support isnt great","I have had the oura ring since June 2023 and have taken care of it well. I have noticed over the course of time I have had it that it does not pick up my activity metrics very accurately. Down to the time frames of when I worked out being hours off from the actual time I worked out. The length of time, type of workout and heart rate seem vert skewed as well.I compared it to my garmin and the calories distance and even heart rate were significantly off -  I have followed every type of reset and update that are recommended and am still not seeing it get more accurate when compared to an apple watch or garmin. I reached out to support within the year I purchased it and they told me there was no way to receive a replacement, and said I should have been more careful with it. For something this expensive it was shocking to me that they did not offer a replacement or some sort of refund. I really like the sleep metrics and want to be able to track that and my cycle and temperature but dont feel I can trust the ring with all the discrepancies I am seeing.

"Great Before Gen 4, Now, NOT","UPDATE: As soon as I posted here and with the BBB, they have issued a refund for the ring and the charger. It seems the person above who I was dealing with agreed that this was taking too long and got it taken care of immediately.Before the Gen 4 ring, I would have given them a 5 star rating. Fist, my charger stopped working (everything is still under warranty). They sent a new one. My ring stopped connecting, then completely died, with the new charger. I am 27 emails in, back and forth and now all of a sudden, after asking me if I wanted to process the return of the ring and the charger, they need to escalate my issue. It appears to me the escalation is an attempt to push the time frame so my warranty runs out. I NEVER had this issue with my previous Oura Rings or their customer service. I will update if they do the right thing.","4","2025-06-14T17:40:05.000Z","DIANE KINNEY","US","3.0"

"Oura misled customers about the Dexcom…","Oura misled customers about the Dexcom integration. They never mentioned it would only be for Stello, which is full pay. When deciding on a ring, I went with the more expensive Oura because of this. Now that they only accept the consumer full pay option for Dexcom, those of us using a CGM are left out. I feel they used this ploy to con it into buying their ring above others. Now that they have us $400+ in, they refuse to explain themselves. I'm stuck with a ring I never would have chosen otherwise.

"A 20-Year Journey in Preventive Health, Perfected by Oura","I’ve been a dedicated Oura Ring user for over four years, but my journey into preventive health technology began much earlier. My choice of Oura was deliberate, driven by a long-standing appreciation for comprehensive health metrics that go beyond simply noticing when you’re sick.Some 20 years ago, my business partner and I founded a preventive health care company called World of Wellness. Our mission was guided by the World Health Organization's definition of health: ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."" We developed a personal health maintenance program built on a digital and physical wellness test. To capture the physical data, we relied on an array of specialized equipment: heart rate monitors, VO2 max machines, stress monitors, and body composition analyzers. It was a cumbersome but necessary process to generate a holistic ""Wellness Index"" for our clients.Fast forward to today, and it’s astonishing what the Oura Ring and its app can accomplish. With the exception of blood pressure and a detailed Body-Impedance Analysis (BIA), the Oura Ring seamlessly provides nearly all the vital statistics that once required a room full of equipment. It has effectively consolidated our old, complex testing protocol into a single, elegant device.For anyone serious about proactive health and understanding the complete picture of their well-being, the Oura Ring is a remarkable tool. It represents the very thing we were trying to build two decades ago—a simple, effective way to maintain personal health—but perfected in a way we could only have dreamed of back then.","5","2025-06-13T20:54:53.000Z","Ebel Magnin","CO","1.0"

I was promised a replacement, waited over a week without any updates, and was then told they can’t ship to Zambia—despite the fact that they sold the ring to me in Zambia in the first place. How does that make sense?I appreciate the concept and the health insights, but the execution and support do not match the price or the hype.","1","2025-06-08T02:01:51.000Z","Dominykas Jonaitis","ZM","1.0"

Everytime they respond (usually 3-5 days if im lucky) they tell me to do the same steps, make sure ring is charged, check this setting and that setting same crap that never works. Repeated this process until I finally cancelled the service. 2 months later get another customer service email telling me to charge and reset.  But they are offering me a whole 6 months no charge.  For a service I cancelled and doesn't work. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  Get a Samsung or UltraHuman and save yourself a huge headache.

"Great service","I purchased my Oura ring on May 15, I learned to love it and keep track of my body. This was especially important to me as I just started a new health journey. The ring was great for the first two weeks but for some reason my battery kept dying ridiculously fast, and it got worse over time and it reached the point of only lasting half the day. So I figured I got a faulty ring. Naturally I would have went to exchange it but I already past the return/exchange period. So I did some googling and saw that Oura does replace the ring as I read in some discussion boards. I reached out to customer service via my Oura app and started with the chat box about my rings battery life, they ran a test and was able to confirm I had a faulty battery. From there the chat box connected me to customer service and they were swift with contacting me and sending a replacement. I’m very happy with the the results of this. Thank you.","5","2025-06-05T18:06:40.000Z","Samira Hamed","US","1.0"

"Don't Trust AI bot or Count on Live Support","After I received my new Oura Ring, setting up the apps I used the online bot.  Great it was really fast, no waiting for those ""..."" intervals. Unfortunately, the AI bot was hallucinating or had incorrect sources and in the process my account was locked. So, it submitted a trouble ticket for me.  Several weekdays (no weekend real support available) later I received a rude response that it was not possible to do what I was attempting to do, while refusing to acknowledge that the AI bot had told me to do it.  Also, the online documentation is complexly organized to be diffifult to navigate only if you already know what is there, and definitely not for finding a fix for an hallucinating problem.  After a few exchanges passed (with days more of gaps) with no actual help but a few hints I was apple to get the iOS app to work. On the last day of my free trial my ticket was passed to a support manager.  She was great, she unlocked my account, clearing up a number of issues.  Only after I gave her a good review did they ask me to post a review on Trustpilot, so I suspect this is not what they anticipated.  The ring data, once you can get to it, is interesting but not necessarily insightful.  But it's a great concept. So, just be prepared to deal with arrogant and unreliable support and to escalate quickly, not that they make that easy either.","2","2025-06-05T01:14:03.000Z","Sylvia Shiroyama","US","3.0"

Also, compensating me with three month paid membership.The main reason I believe was when oura introduced oxygen sensing, I have noticed a big drain but I realized later when I was analyze it after oura replies on my concern. Once I closed this feature, the battery is now surviving longer enough as needed to be. Hopefully this feature gets fixed but oura team to minimize battery drain to use this feature during my sleep.Thanks oura team","5","2025-06-02T07:10:21.000Z","zenab ismail","QA","1.0"

"Life changing","This little ring has quietly tracked some of the biggest changes of my life. Over the past year, I’ve gone through major healing — quitting Adderall, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, cleaning up my sleep, resetting my nervous system — and Oura has been with me through all of it.It’s helped me actually see what’s going on in my body when my mind is all over the place. Sleep, stress, cycles, recovery — it doesn’t lie. And it’s been one of the only things keeping me accountable when motivation slips.Sometimes it just feels good to have proof that your hard work is doing something. That you’re not crazy. That healing isn’t always visible, but it’s real. I’m not saying Oura changed my life — but it definitely helped me change it.","5","2025-06-01T08:12:43.000Z","Lauren Bowman","US","1.0"

"Customer service literally non existent","I love my ring, however customer service is quite literally non existent! There is a chatbot called Finn that simply over and over again asks for your email address for you to await an email message from someone at some point. If like me, you want and need to speak to a physical person it’s literally impossible! I’ve also found the cost of a replacement charger / locating one in correct size (gen3) nigh on impossible and to have one sent from Oura itself costs a ridiculous amount in postage far more than any other overseas company I’ve ever bought from. In summary, good product, but non existent customer service. Incredibly frustrating. Also, reading through many other reviews lamenting the fact that a product that costs the best part of half a grand has no physical agents to speak to I see Oura respond with “if you ask for live agent you will be connected to one”. Lies! Chatbot Finn will not ever connect you!! I have tried 5 times over asking for a live agent in every manner conceivable and it keeps asking for an email address “in order to connect me”. Lies: once an email address is sent it says “await email response” and abruptly terminates the conversation. I wish it were possible to post the screenshots of these incredibly frustrating chatbot conversations to prove the Oura official responses on here are lies, you will not be connected to a real live agent. Well, I am abruptly terminating my subscription with them since customer service cannot even be called shocking I guess as it flat out doesn’t even exist!","1","2025-05-29T12:56:49.000Z","Emma Paul","GB","3.0"

"Apple Watch to Oura 4","I wore an Apple Watch before the ring but wanted something more “ambient” and less “alert focused”. Initially, I was a little worried about accuracy, insights and also whether it would scratch badly. On the metrics side, it seems about right - as in not a million miles away from my Apple Watch which I wore in tandem for a few weeks. I really like the fact it interprets the metrics and turns them into more useful insights… like readiness, symptom radar, and resilience. And I like the richer sleep tracking and more integrated use of HRV. On the scratch side, it’s held up remarkably well… I’ve been relatively careful (e.g. wearing gloves when gardening, “paws” when using weights) but I do forgot now and again, and have accidentally run it along rough surfaces and, so far, any marks have just rubbed off, like it self heals to some degree. So, 9 months in, not a single scratch… which is pretty surprising. I also like the new features that get released, like better activity tracking, better nap detection, symptom radar, AI meal tracking (just take a photo and get a high-level breakdown), and other things. The Support team is also great. I had some battery questions and they helped out, even checking the data they could see about the device to advise me. So, so far, very impressed and I would recommend… especially if you’re into quiet and mindful tech that’s easy to live with.","5","2025-06-07T05:14:51.000Z","I Short","GB","3.0"

The combination of both lead us to have great choices on how to behave to try to achieve a better lifestyle.

"Expensive mistake – disappointing accuracy and poor value (so far)","I initially rated the Oura Ring 1 star, but I’ve now raised this to 2 stars after Oura customer service offered a 12-month complimentary membership as a goodwill gesture. I appreciate the effort to make things right and may consider updating this rating further if I have a better experience during this period.I really regret buying the Oura Ring. For £300 plus a £5.99/month subscription, I expected reliable and useful health data. Unfortunately, the sleep tracking has been inaccurate on multiple occasions — including nights where I was clearly awake for several hours in bed, yet the ring still reported this time as restful sleep. Worse still, the option is not available to simply manually update the numbers to fix its inaccuracies, which makes the Oura Ring very unreliable.Looking back, I wish I had chosen a different product—something with better accuracy, more flexible functionality, and without the burden of a monthly subscription just to access key features. I raised my concerns with Oura’s customer service and requested a refund, but was told that inaccuracies didn’t fall under their warranty, and that refunds are only available within 30 days of purchase. Given the price, the subscription model, and the health-related use case I explained, I was left very disappointed by the lack of resolution.If you’re considering this ring for health monitoring, I’d recommend looking elsewhere. Other options like the Samsung Ring don’t require a monthly fee and may offer better value. Oura’s high price, limited accuracy, and paywalled features have left me very disappointed — though I now wait to see whether the experience improves over the complimentary year of access.","1","2025-06-02T13:59:26.000Z","Direct_Truth","GB","7.0"

I’m trying to arrange a return ans having to deal with chatbot for it to say there is an issue with my order number.I don’t expect to pay £400 for an item and have all this inconvenience. I just wouldn’t expect this kind of error when spending that type of money on a fitness tracker. The worse thing is, if I hadn’t have been glancing on the website, I’d have never known I had in fact been sent the wrong sizers and the ring was the incorrect size.It’s so unprofessional and has put me off proceeding with the order!","2","2025-05-22T17:32:27.000Z","Leanne","GB","1.0"

I was devastated to be without my ring for so long, however my replacement came in 2 days. I immediately did everything I needed to do to get back in business. But after a day my ring wasn’t connecting and all the remedy fixes didn’t work. I again, reached out to tech support and when we tried to troubleshoot again without success my case was escalated.

Normally  plated rings don’t fade this easily, so of course i am disappointed when i paid more money for a gold topcoat. It’s small now, but I am afraid it will deteriorate faster now and I still think its way too soon. + I now read on the site that to avoid damage oura-users should wear the ring on their non-dominant hand. That should have been  in the sizing video and sizing information. My ring fits the best on my dominant index finger, so switching gave me an inaccurate reading.Update 19-5: I gave my information (email address), but customerservice did not get in touch with me (yet).

The process was smooth, and the restored ring works perfectly (looks and feels brand new!). What stood out was how they turned a frustrating situation into a demonstration of integrity. In an era where companies nickel-and-dim customers, Oura’s willingness to stand behind their product—even years later—is rare and refreshing.  Yes, the membership model takes getting used to, but the hardware quality and *this* level of service make it worth it.

They took the time to thoroughly understand my situation and provided comprehensive support without ever overstepping any privacy boundaries. It was clear they valued my information and handled everything with the utmost respect. Their commitment to both excellent service and data privacy is truly commendable.","5","2025-05-13T18:01:40.000Z","Andy Andrew","US","2.0"
"Best ring on the market at the moment.","Oura has made me very satisfied recently with the introduction of several new features which helps to set the company apart from other ring brands. I really appreciate how Oura listens to their community and Oura is one of the few brands who is very involved and active in their community. They frequently respond to comments on their social media and are heavily involved in apps such as Reddit. I think this improves brand trust and shows their community that they are listening. Some people including myself are not thrilled about paying a monthly subscription fee, however if Oura continues to regularly update their product with new meaningful features then im okay with the monthly fee. I’ve never had an issue with my rings so I can’t speak to their support, but I know they have addressed some of their shortcomings and it looks like they are trying to make it better.","5","2025-05-13T06:11:49.000Z","Carson Lewis","US","2.0"

Even though my initial conversation was over a weekend, by Monday morning, the Oura team identified an issue, and without any further engagement on my part, they asked me to verify my ring size and my shipping address get me a replacement. Most ""chat bots"" force you into frustrating conversations before escalating a problem. NOT so with Oura which was a true breath of fresh air. I've been an Oura owner since 2019.

Things I slept between 6pm and midnight and that I was awake after midnight. The opposite of what actually happened. This has led to inaccurate data.

"Exceeding expectations","I've had my Oura ring for about 4 months and thus far it has exceeded expectations. I was already familiar with the ring, as close family members have one, but I still did a ton of research before making the plunge. After all, it is a high investment ($400+subscription) and high commitment (wearing a new piece of 'jewelry' 24x7 moving forward) for something some people say is obvious (um, I don't need a score to tell me I slept poorly last night). But thus far, I've really enjoyed all the stats, and love the look of it. All was good until my ring suddenly stopped working. I spent some time going through all the recommended resets and troubleshooting, to no avail. Finally wrote Oura and to their credit, they diagnosed it and said they would send out a new ring, and it got shipped to me (from the Netherlands!) and I was back tracking in less than 7 days. Hopefully that will be the only hiccup, but so far I'm really loving it.","5","2025-04-28T17:56:12.000Z","JH","US","1.0"

"Unreliable devices and poor customer service!","I would like to preface this review by stating that I have been an Oura customer since the earliest days of the company and have purchased Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3 rings at full price through their website. In the beginning, I was quite happy with the sleep tracking and also customer service, however as the company has grown they have obviously veered far from their roots and at this point I can no longer recommend anyone purchase an Oura Ring.tldr; poor customer support, unreliable hardware, and recommendations that are too “friendly” and don’t reflect the actual underlying data.My woes began when my Heritage Stealth Gen 3 ring all of a sudden stopped holding a charge, despite being less than a year old. It would simply die after 24 hours or so. I contacted support and was told they detected an issue with the battery and would send me a replacement. Which they did. An exact replacement - Heritage Stealth Gen 3. However this replacement ring suffered an even worse fate after only 9 months or so, when one day a few weeks ago it simply decided to stop connecting to my phone. I went through all the troubleshooting steps and yet it simply wouldn’t respond. It’s important to note that I have been very careful with all of my rings, never subjected them to any abnormal wear and tear or anything like that at all. So this was definitely some kind of internal hardware defect.This time when I reached out to support, however, I was told that I could either choose to receive a discount code with a value of 50 euros/50 dollars to purchase a new ring or I would again be provided with a replacement ring, only this time it would not be a brand-new ring but a refurbished ring, since this was technically a “replacement of a replacement”. The fact that two Gen 3 rings literally died within a year should make anyone considering purchasing an Oura stop and think twice.Ultimately I opted for the replacement ring, and here is where things get wild: although I was promised, in writing, that I would again receive the exact same model and size ring as a replacement, I received a completely different model! Upon bringing this to the customer service rep’s attention, a new rep began replying all of a sudden and directly lied to me, saying that the warranty terms allow Oura to replace a defective ring with any ring of their choosing, which is obviously not the case - the warranty terms are very clear that the replacement ring will only be the same model and size as the ring being replaced.After going back and forth with this new rep numerous times, I was ultimately told that they were not willing to take back the wrong ring and send me the correct replacement, and I was basically out of luck. So now I'm stuck with a ring that I don't like and will only wear at night in bed.Besides the extremely disappointing way this situation was handled, I would also like to note that I currently wear a Whoop strap and an Apple Watch Ultra 2 together with the ring and have noticed extreme discrepancies between the three, with Oura’s activity tracking (steps and calorie burn) being way, way off from reality and the other two devices. Sleep tracking still seems fairly accurate, although Oura’s approach is much more “lenient” - Whoop will tell me that my sleep sucked and I am not at all recovered and need to relax and take it easy, for example, while Oura will basically show the same data but tell me that I’m fine and I should go do something active if I feel up to it. Combine that with Oura's high price and other competitors' rings providing the same functionality for cheaper and without a subscription, and I simply cannot in good faith recommend anyone purchase an Oura Ring now.","1","2025-04-27T19:22:12.000Z","Alexander Kirsch-Clayton","DE","22.0"

"Non-Existant Customer Service","I purchased an Oura ring late February, and after wearing it for two weeks, I decided that it just wasn't for me. My husband has one and loves it. While I found the sleep data to be spot-on, I felt that the daytime activity data was not accurate for me. I work at a desk and don't move much, but probably due to excessive hand gestures, my ring thought I was moving quite a bit. I was therefore getting better activity scores than I should have been, while missing out on reminders to get up and move around. I returned the ring through the online portal two weeks after receiving it. I can confirm that they received it on March 21st, according to the FedEx tracking. It's now four weeks later, and I haven't received a refund. I reached out to their customer service 9 days ago, and they stated that it required a ""specialist"" to review my case. I haven't heard back since, despite sending three more messages asking for updates. Anyone purchasing should know that you can't talk to customer service directly; you need to send a message and wait for a response. Initially, I would have recommended Oura to someone looking to improve their sleep because the sleep data is great. Due to their customer service issues, I honestly do not recommend purchasing this product.","1","2025-04-21T20:18:09.000Z","Amy Van Beek","US","2.0"

As a business owner, I can appreciate that issues with product can occur and for me, it’s not about the issue but how the business rectifies that issue through their customer service channels. Oura did a great job assessing the issue, communicating with me and providing a replacement. This was all done seamlessly and most importantly, quickly. Don’t often write reviews but you guys deserve it. Thanks.","5","2025-04-20T18:23:53.000Z","Jason Tsarouhas","AU","2.0"

Love the ring too!When I initially set up my account something went wrong and I had to reinstall the app.  Apparently I used a different email address the second time - so definitely my fault.  This resulted in me getting charged twice for the annual subscription but customer service figured out the problem and promptly refunded the duplicate charge.  Yes you have to start with the AI Bott “Finn” but when Finn couldn’t resolve the problem ,he forwarded my issue to customer service.  When level 1 customer service could not resolve the problem, my issue was escalated to the financial department.  That was where the problem was identified and my refund processed.  It did take about a week but I am pleased with the service I received.","5","2025-04-19T21:30:05.000Z","Corinne","US","3.0"

I used the data the ring provided to coordinate my activity and restorative practices, along with cutting back on my food intake, and I lost 20 pounds in the first thirty days.  My sleep rating is optimal.  The issue was my ring was now too big.  Oura has a one time exchange program, but living in the rural Upper Peninsula of Michigan, I was nervous about losing my momentum during the exchange process. This was no issue at all! I sent my ring out Monday afternoon, and received my new smaller sized ring on Friday of the same week!  I am impressed, impressed with the data that the ring provides, impressed by the customer service, and impressed with the success the ring has helped me to achieve in my personal goals.

"Would not recommend","I can only comment on the first generation Ring but it’s uncomfortable to wear due to its thickness and also the little nubbins underneath. In fact, I had to stop wearing as it peeled the skin from my finger, leaving what looked and felt like a burn mark. It also never stays in the same position - like all rings, it turns throughout the day. As the Ring needs to be in the correct position (nubbins down), it’s annoying constantly having to adjust.","2","2025-04-19T09:24:19.000Z","Mr David Shepherd","GB","15.0"

Asking for certain information. Not having exactly all that they wanted I did my best and went to bed. Next morning laughing to my wife I said wonder if there is a reply.  To my amazement there was. They had confirmed there was a problem with the ring. Where sending me a new one. Extending the warranty and not to worry about returning the old ring. This being the day before Easter I was amazed.

"Shocking customer service.","After 3 months of functioning fine my Oura stopped giving Blood Oxygen and Breathing Regularity data, while still reporting on all other measures. It is very difficult to get a decent Customer Service response - no phone number, first couple of interactions with a ChatBot with the usual ""was it fully charged"", ""have you tried switching it off and on again"" for days before escalated to an online exchange with a person. Have been through several hoops with their suggestions, the last of which, 10 days ago, was to undertake 2 100%-25% charge cycles making regular manual back-ups. Having suggested this they proposed closing the ticket!!! As the problem had not been resolved I insisted the ticket remain open. Advice followed, still no data, notified them of this 3 days ago and not heard a thing from them. Shocking. The ring was expensive, only 3 months old, bought from John Lewis, paying full subscription and have had 3 weeks of missing data and no real customer service to speak of.","1","2025-04-18T12:36:13.000Z","Lorna","GB","2.0"

"As a very long time oura customer","As a very long time oura customer. I’ve owned an Oura ring since the very first gen 1 (which was so chunky, and big; but it seemed magical all the same), all the way through a decades worth of Oura’s generations, and now onto Gen 4.This was a request for review of a recent customer service experience. Therefore, this review doesn’t cover my experiences with the Oura ring. Below is from my response to them when they requested feedback, and then requested I post it here as well. I suppose I’m happy to, because I’ve been so passionate about this brand, and its products, yet there’s been an extremely noticeable change in regards to customer service, and support. I absolutely love to recognize standout experiences from individual employees when they provide the level of support that was Oura’s standard, until the last one, to two years. Below is my requested feedback. Then I was asked to post on here. I just wanted to provide context…I have to make this extremely clear. The main reason I decided to fill out this survey is because I’m am so confused as to what happened to the exceptional, outstanding, noteworthy, talented, knowledgeable, kind, patient, understanding, and prompt solution based customer service I knew Oura to be; that is up until about 1, or 2 years ago. My experience with Declan yesterday was good. He’s one of the good ones I hope Oura takes care of, because us customers need more representatives that have been with the company for many years, and still adheres to the Oura brand’s bar it always set so high(until as of late). There’s a few representatives I’ve worked with that remind me there’s still some great representatives with Oura. As far as I can gather now; they are the ones who have been with Oura for several years, and still hold the standard that Oura set! Exceptional! Genuinely, they had completed the entire package that is Oura, by providing extremely detailed, prompt, well communicated care for any, and every concern. I think that my purchase of the gen 4 is the very first time I properly realized what a problem the customer support service is now, because for the first time, I realized I’m making an investment purchase(which I’ve never hesitated on as I can’t imagine not having one after 10 years of daily wear. I paused on this purchase because I now know that should anything concerning come up, or if I had a question; I used to feel so secure knowing no matter what, help was only a quick message away, and the help, resolution, or guidance would come promptly back to me. Now, it’s entirely luck of the draw. Before recently, I’ve only had outstanding customer service experiences with Oura. If I were a new customer however; I’d probably have discontinued supporting Oura due to the new customer services extremely delayed, disorganized, disappointing, disrespectful, and downright incompetent service. I know that may sound like a rough statement to conclude, and share, but i genuinely just hope new customers aren’t being treated with this care. I’ve recommended it to more people than I could ever count, and when several of them have asked me what to do about dealing with the extreme challenges of the recent changes in their customer support, I feel awful. Half the time it’s an exact replica general response, which essentially dismiss the customer, as they don’t address anything directly, or provide assistance with the actual concerns stated by them, and provide no solution, or provide any kind of help. I have no idea what changed in the last 2 years, but something has absolutely changed with the customer support representatives. I’m not sure if Oura has grown exponentially, and to the degree where you now have to outsource your customer support services, and they’re trained differently? I hBut whatever Oura is currently doing is NOT working. I had anxiety over purchasing the new gen 4 , which sounds ridiculous; but I learned that you can no longer depend on Oura’s customer support anymore! So I felt afraid because I know I’m on my own if anything goes wrong. However, because I was matched with Declan this time; it eased my concerns. I was lucky. And it’s also of note that I’ve been with Oura for a decade so I know… I know the change. I know what you’re capable of, and I know the bar has dropped severely as far as customer support! Severely!!! Lucky for Oura I’m a long time original customer, so i know what to do(ignore the incompetent representatives who I feel either lack reading comprehension, or simply could NOT care less that they are losing customers for Oura. And I just wait until i get ahold of a long time representative who remembers the way Oura was before whatever happened over the last 2 years. Please!!!! Pleaseee!!!! Clean house! I nearly dropped Oura altogether simply because I can’t trust the customer service.","5","2025-04-18T06:47:42.000Z","Caro Ford","US","1.0"

"I am extremely pleased with how Oura…","I am extremely pleased with how Oura handled an issue I was having with my ring. My battery kept draining faster and faster and I decided to reach out to customer service to see what could be done. Within 1 minute I was given a link so they could run a diagnostic test. The outcome of the test showed a battery issue and there was an immediate solution presented, which was to send me a brand new ring completely free of charge. Then not even an hour later, a representative named Emma collected all my demographic information for where to send my new ring, and to get the color, size, and model. Then within  no time at all I received a confirmation order that my new ring has been ordered and soon will be on its way- completely free of charge. The entire process start to finish was 1-2 hours and they even said to keep my ring and give it to someone else! I am blown away by the customer service. I love my Oura ring so much- it has improved the quality of my life in every way. And now knowing how easy the customer service team is to work with, I’m officially an Oura customer for life. Thank you, Oura!","5","2025-04-11T16:53:03.000Z","Kelsey Wetmore","US","1.0"
"Oura - excellent product and excellent customer support","I have been using the Oura ring since 2021. I’ve started with gen 2 and upgraded whenever a new version of the ring was available. During this time I run twice into issues with my rings. Both times customer support was EXCELLENT: focused, mannered and most of all willing to help with everything they could. Even their virtual assistant is great and defers fast to a human if they cannot help further. Also, at one point I wrote a feedback to the company “complaining” that they don’t take into account or manage pregnant women (a situation I was just experiencing). Not only did they reply in few hours but they sent me tons of material on how to benefit from the info the ring provides even if they do not have specifics for pregnant women. Also few months later they started introducing features that take into account pregnancy. I don’t know if my feedback had anything to do with it but I’ve felt heard and I felt important 😅. I will always recommend Oura to anyone that wants a very good product supported by awesome people.","5","2025-04-11T14:36:47.000Z","Alexandra Zdrafcu","RO","1.0"

"Lifesaver in a Ring – Oura Gen 4 Caught My Chest Infection Early!","I can’t say enough good things about the Oura Ring Gen 4. One of the most impressive features for me has been the Symptom Radar. It flagged signs of strain on my body before I even realized something was wrong—turns out I had a chest infection! Thanks to the early warning, I was able to get checked out and start treatment before things got worse.The ring itself is sleek and super comfortable to wear all day and night. It gives me detailed insights on my sleep, recovery, and readiness, and now I truly listen to what my body needs. The app is really intuitive, and the health data feels incredibly personalized and accurate.If you’re looking for a smart health tracker that goes beyond the basics, Oura Gen 4 is the one. I genuinely feel more in tune with my health, and in this case, it may have even helped me catch a serious issue early. Highly recommended!","5","2025-04-10T22:14:00.000Z","Mahi","GB","2.0"

"Great Customer Service and the Product in general","Oura Customer Service is very empathetic, to the point, understanding and overall very nice to deal with.Oura's policy when it comes to the replacement of a faulty ring is also very generous. I had 2 rings, one mine and one of my mother's. Both of them started experiencing batter issues roughly after 3 years, reducing their battery time to less than 1 day (from around 6-7 initially) which was not ideal considering the purpose of these rings.Despite being a couple of months over the warranty period, in both cases, Ouras Support confirmed the issue with a faulty battery and proposed either a discount on the next purchase OR a free restored replacement ring.In both cases, we got replacement ring,s which are working fine and continue to hold the battery charge for around 5-6 days. Overall, definitely a great experience and the product is also very nice, helping keep track of overall wellbeing, sleep patterns, records activities and exercises and gives a nice overview of body vitals with indication towards restoration or stress periods.I strongly recommend this product and the company and will likely buy the next Gen Oura rings once our current replacement rings stop working. Great value for money.","5","2025-04-09T15:58:38.000Z","Pawel Szulc","US","2.0"

The algorithm often knows I’m coming down with something before I do. It has helped me learn my own patterns and in some cases, become more in tune with my body. When I recently had an issue with my battery, the AI ran a quick diagnostic and initiated a replacement, Quick and painless. I’ll admit I was a little annoyed when I asked to change the color for my replacement ring to gold and they said no because it was higher value by $50. I wanted to just pay the difference for my replacement ring to be a different color but that wasn’t an option. That seems silly because I was willing to pay the difference but, all in all, I’m happy with my ring and the customer service.","5","2025-04-09T05:56:03.000Z","Meghan Beaudry","US","1.0"

The email also explained clearly where to find my ring info (serial number, etc) which was very helpful.

"They stand by their product, and provide timely customer service.","Since 2023 everyone in my family now owns an Oura Ring, as well as many friends and acquaintances to many of whom I've recommended the product. Not one of them has had an problematic issue with the ring, but as luck would have it I did. After submitting a support ticket this past Sunday I was contacted via email by Val from Oura, and based on my description of the issue I was offered a free replacement of my Gen3 Horizon or a discount for the new model. I opted for the free replacement, and it'll be here tomorrow (four days from opening the support ticket) . I don't really ever go out of my way to review anything, but I felt that the level of attention I recieved, the ease of the process, and especially the outcome warranted some recognition.","5","2025-04-02T20:29:25.000Z","Patrick Hall","US","1.0"

"Great Customer Service","I upgraded my Gen 3 ring to Gen 4 last year.  The ring gave unusual readings for my heart rate and failed to connect to my iPhone frequently.  After getting an upgraded iPhone, the ring would not connect at all.  I finally put in a ticket to Oura about the Bluetooth connection issue and within 24 hours, they'd replied that they'd noticed an issue with my ring and immediately offered to replace it.  The rep was very helpful and I had several back and forths about the performance of the ring.  The rep issued me a future 2 month credit on my subscription.  Through it all, the customer service was quick, courteous and completely customer-centric.  I appreciate that.  They sent me a replacement in short order and asked me to return the old one so they could study it. I appreciate that this company wants to learn about any issues with their product rather than just solving the immediate issue.  This new ring works so much better.  I'm very happy with it and my experience with the company.","5","2025-03-30T22:18:13.000Z","Lisa M","US","1.0"

"DO NOT BUY FROM OURA (Order # SO-43454257 )","I made an order (Order #: SO-43454257) and three days after getting it decided that I did not like it. So as per policy I returned the ring and have been waiting for a refund since the 10th of march. Nothing. My HSA card can see when a refund is being pushed back and it hasn't been initiated yet. It has been 18 days now. This is theft of my money. The chat box is very unhelpful, I never get responses to contact requests and at this point I am very angry. I want my over $400 back and I am done with a stupid chat box who lied directly to me telling me it was a real person because I was angry. Try getting some customer service from real people and give my back my hard earned money. This has been a headache. I need that money back, this company has been nothing but awful to work with. Above was the original review and this was their original response: ""Hi, Hannah.I'm truly sorry for the frustration and inconvenience you've experienced with your refund. I completely understand how upsetting this situation is, especially given the amount of time you've been waiting and the difficulty in getting answers.I was to assure you that you are being heard and I am here to help. I have escalated your ticket to our internal specialists and have highlighted it to our senior agents to ensure it gets the attention it deserves. Rest assured your case is being actively worked on, and our specialist team will be in touch with you via email shortly to update you.We truly appreciate your patience and understanding. I'll do everything I can to make sure this is taken care of as quickly as possible. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. - Rebecca, Oura Social Support Team.""It has now been 3 days since that and 21 days since they received the ring back. Not a word. Not a single email. NOTHING. I am obviously not being heard and I obviously have not been ""escalated"". You have stolen $417.94 from me and I will be getting it back one way or the other. I have been forced to put in a dispute with my HSA card and have the proof from the tracking page with the shipping details showing it arrived to them on the 10th AND I have screenshots of this and their return policies. This has been one joke after another. As of 4/3/2025 it has been a week since I was told I would get a response, STILL NOTHING. I even tried through the AI chat bot AGAIN. NOOOOOTHING. This is fraud, I have returned the ring per the company policies and they are keeping my money and not helping me as they say they will. I am waiting for the dispute to come through at this point. NEVER buy from this company.","1","2025-04-03T15:35:47.000Z","Hannah Taylor","US","1.0"

"A Great Tool and Wealth of Information & Support","I purchased my Oura Ring 4 in Feb 2025 from Best Buy. I have to say that, although I read about the Oura Ring and had an idea how it worked, I was not prepared for the wealth of information it provided. I use a couple apps like Apple Health, Cronometer, and HeadsUp - all which integrate easily with my Oura Ring. So, I have a fantastic, comprehensive view of my health at a glance.  Unfortunately, I started having problems with my ring in early March - it just stopped connecting with my phone app. Although I’m reluctant to use any “chat” help (mostly because it’s almost always a bot that can’t “do” anything), I gave it a shot. Was pleasantly surprised!The automated “helper” kicked off a quick diagnostic test and identified a problem with the battery on my Oura Ring. I was prompted for some information about my Oura Ring which was super easy to find in the app and a ticket was opened for me. I thought it would be a day or two before I heard anything but… nope. I was surprised again.Oura responded in about an hour and asked me to confirm some information. Then they said since my Oura Ring was under warranty, it would be replaced at no cost. I got the replacement ring in a few days and - thanks to the super easy step-by-step instructions in the app - I had the new ring set up in 3-4 minutes and picked up right where I left off. I did not lose any of my previous data because the information was backed up in the process of deactivating the old ring and activating the new ring.While I’ve experienced a great many product and support disappointments when it comes to health information tools, apps, and customer support, my experience with the Oura Ring 4, Oura (as a company), and Oura’s customer support have been A-mazing.","5","2025-03-28T01:29:20.000Z","Mark Templeton","US","1.0"

"Excellent Customer Service","I recently purchased the Oura Ring 4, but upon receipt, I found that there was an issue with the battery and the ring wouldn’t hold charge for more than a day. Using the Oura app, I chatted with their AI assistant who performed a diagnostic check of my battery and determined that it was faulty. It immediately created a ticket and passed me over to customer support, who contacted me within the next hour. Customer support was fantastic to work with, and after confirming my shipping information, they told me that a new replacement ring would be shipped as soon as possible. That was midday yesterday and the new ring is scheduled to deliver in two days.  It was the best customer service experience that I’ve had in quite some time. I would recommend Oura to anyone considering purchasing a ring because they stand behind their product and will take care of the customer if there is an issue.","5","2025-03-27T03:04:43.000Z","Jaycie Toller","US","1.0"

"Ring 4 is pretty bad","TLDR the oura ring 4 is pretty bad, worse than the previous Gen 3.it's really expensive, way more than 3 and still has a membership on top.The Gen 3 has a premium feel with rounded edges. Gen 4 feels like cheap plastic with annoying sharp corners on the edges.it's really bad data for like a workout and decent for overall health over a longer period of time. the data is nice to have but it's nothing unique and is wrong occasionally. it should be a third the price though. The ring still doesn't offer half sizes which I really need, so only 1 size kinda fits on 1 finger. I can immediately tell it's the wrong size and it falls off frequently but unfortunately it's the only size I can use since ridiculously there are no half sizes.","1","2025-03-21T12:50:44.000Z","SKim","US","6.0"

No one seems to be doing anything and making it seem like I'm the problem, insinuating that my email address was wrong or I put the order under another email which is not correct. The problem is with your website. It's not my fault your website has issues. You have charged my FSA card for the ring and 1 year membership. And you have charged me bank card for an extended warranty for a ring thats not in process to be shipped. Create an order and make sure my membership starts the day you process the order (not on 3/9/24 because of your website errors). If have given you all the information you requested and nothing. Fix this…OR refund my FSA account for the oura ring 4 and 1 year membership and refund my bank card for the extended warrant immediately. This is insanity for a global brand. If I could go be customer service zero stars I would. Ordered the 4 on the website. FSA account charged for the ring and my bank card was charged TWICE for the extended warranty. No order confirmation. No response via multiple emails even though they claim a 24 hr response time. Asked for help on X, to whici they repliwd to DM them the incident number. But you can't send a direct message to them on X unless you upgrade to a premium account. And I'm not doing that! This is insanity! At this point I just want ALL my money refunded back to both forms of payment immediately. This is a scam!","1","2025-03-12T18:00:13.000Z","TN","US","1.0"

I was so stressed and worried about what it was going to take to figure out what was wrong, I read people stating they couldn’t get ahold of Oura customer service, etc. I did not experience this at all, it was the quickest response time I’ve ever had from a company via email, text, phone, etc. and was super easy to get my replacement.

A few times it’s noticed I’ve picked up a cold/flu bug before I do, I immediately increase rest, increase water, add some echinacea and zinc… symptoms come, but have always very mild and short-lived, presumably from the early intervention.Customer service has been exceptional.

"Scam vibes with difficult refunds and slow customer service. Do not expect ANY customer service despite paying AUD $644 for a ring and $100+ yearly fees","A day after I received my Oura ring, I decided that I would like to get a refund. I thought it would be a simple process right? Nup, the company webpage recommends that you talk to customer service if you are from Australia. When you do this, the chat box Finn tells you to look at the webpage for more information. Infinite loop, with Finn repeatedly telling you to go through the order section to request a refund (note: it doesn’t even exist for Australian customers) Then, I finally reach a human. Human takes more than 24 hours to reply to even the simplest questions. Literally been waiting back and forth for DAYS trying to get this sorted. Then to mess it all up, all I asked was a simple inquiry regarding the approx cost of shipping back from Australia. Alexis informed me that they can refund the shipping cost. So I proceeded with the refund and they booked me in for DHL express to collect it from my house. Then they send me an email that the shipping is not refundable. Note I explicitly asked about the shipping cost, and explicitly asked that I only wanted to proceed after knowing the cost. Now I am stuck potentially having to pay $136 aud to ship it back to the Netherlands on top of the non-refundable fees. Thats extremely messed up especially since I EMAILED TO ASK. Also, if I had known, I would not have agreed- and would have asked whether I can use my own postage service etc or atleast thought about it more. Already been over a day, EVERY day of back and forth with Oura, and am still waiting for a response.","1","2025-03-04T04:20:48.000Z","Sarah li","AU","3.0"

Worse is the the app - which you have to pay a subscription for, takes the daytime reading as a nightime one and sends your results plummeting. Update. Oura reached out and after I sent screenshots of the times over the previous two weeks of the ring not collecting heart rate and HRV data at night, they are replacing my defective ring under warranty.","4","2025-03-11T16:59:03.000Z","An Englishman in Latvia","LV","8.0"

Tried the sizing kit, I really like that they sending you one in advance to try out! But went with the advice to size down when inbetween sizes, because the material will be some smoother than that of the sizing kit. Regret that decision now, it’s too tight. I feel like there could be more information about what is too tight. So I’m going to return it for a size bigger. I’m from the Netherlands, so return needs to happen via customer service. Left a ticket to do so yesterday, so will update on how that goes. But for now really happy and when exploring the app, I really felt like it is going to give a lot of insight! The gold colour isn’t the most pretty next to my real gold, it’s more of a in your face gold with a bit of a green undertone.

The extended warranties are handled by a third-party vendor that works with Oura Rings. On 12-28-2024, I received a welcomed email from Extend, but it was only showing one warranty. I got in contact with Extend and they informed me they were missing the invoice for the second ring, and I need to notify Oura Rings and have them email the invoice to  Extend's Warranty Ops dept. I notified Oura Rings on 12-29-2024 about the missing warranty and told them all they needed to do was send a copy of my invoice to rectify the situation. I have been in constant contact with Oura Rings and this situation is still outstanding.  It’s been 4 weeks, and I do not understand why it is taking them so long to get this situation resolved. I worked for Citicorp in their quality assurance department. I consistently had to deal with emailing reports, invoices, and requests. I know it is not a difficult process to attach an invoice to an email and forward it. I am very disappointed with Oura Ring customer service response to my situation. I am being told they are working on it, but the issue is still outstanding.

Virtual assistent told me to try the steps on the help page. Which made it worse, because now it’s not even connected in the app. Tried again via the virtual assistant, got the same response. So I tried reaching out again. Gave it a couple of days, because they state it’s busy (because of all the inquiries about the oura4, after reading the bad reviews about costumer service..I think it’s not about that at all). Got a response; we see your ring connects to us, so it’s working. Then I tried to DM via Instagram, got a response for a number. Replied, never heard back. Even when I started to get frustrated and begged for a living human being instead of that shit assistant on the website to contact me, no response. Finally someone reached out, checking with me to see if my charger was broken. It was not. Asked me again for some information, I replied and haven’t heard back in a week. So now I try to start a warranty procedure because I’m stuck with a broken ring, costing me €500 and a membership for over €70 euro’s, all worthless and not functioning. And I get stuck in a costumer service loop of hell. When I try to start the warranty procedure, I receive a standardised mail from Finn to reach out and contact costumer service to start the procedure. The only way to reach out to this company is via the same assistant. So you start another chat stating you want to the start the warranty procedure, which generates an automatic email from Finn to reach out and contact a costumer service member. Which you cannot because the only way to get into contact is via that virtual assistant. Even when you click the links in the “help” articles you get nowhere, but referred back to Finn. At this point, I don’t know what the do. Because this company just ignores its costumers. Please do not fall for this, because you lose your money and get a shit product.

"Order no. SO-10583404 and SO-10518988","I placed orders SO-10583404 and SO-10518988 for over 600 dollars with Oura back in October 2021 and have been dealing with unresolved issues ever since. Despite numerous attempts to find a solution—whether by requesting a refund or asking for the products to be delivered to any of the address of the official residence outside Russia—the company has consistently failed to fulfill its own terms and conditions.Oura repeatedly cites sanctions as the reason they cannot deliver or process a refund, even though I have not lived in a sanctioned country for years. I currently reside in Spain, hold legal EU residency, and have provided multiple alternative shipping and banking options in Georgia, Italy, Germany, and England. Despite this, Oura has always found reasons to avoid resolving the issue, which ultimately points to a lack of competence rather than genuine external limitations.Over the course of nearly four years, not only has no information been updated or changed, but Oura has failed to offer anything at all to improve the customer experience—not even a lifetime subscription or any form of compensation. This is especially disappointing, given that I am a returning customer who trusted the company enough to place a second order.Instead of working with me to find a reasonable resolution, their only response is to keep my ticket open indefinitely with vague promises that “the situation may change.” Meanwhile, I remain without either the product or a refund.I understand the difficulties posed by geopolitical issues, but Oura’s complete refusal to accommodate a long-standing, loyal customer despite clear legal residency in the EU and several viable solutions is unacceptable. This is not just a matter of unfortunate circumstances—it’s a reflection of poor customer service and a lack of accountability.If you are considering purchasing from Oura, be aware that their ability to deliver products or resolve issues appears entirely unreliable. You might end up, like me, waiting for years with no resolution in sight.","1","2025-01-15T06:30:07.000Z","Liliya","IT","2.0"

"Terrible Service continues","I ordered a ring as a gift prior to Christmas and was sent the wrong size. Following numerous @mails I am still waiting for the correct ring to be sent.They will not send the correct ring until the other one has been returned despite them causing the problem.I have been left waiting for them to arrange collection of the item for over a week and still no news.Terrible customer service and a very poor effort on their part. I have suggested that they send the correct size ring which I ordered while they sort their mess out but they will not entertain that approach so no further forwardUPDATE I am still no further forward with this issue which has now been dragging on for over three weeks. Every time I send an email I get a response a couple of days later from a different person. You say that you have created a new order to send me the correct ring that I paid over £500 for. That is all well and good but why have you not dispatched the order and had it delivered.

"The app is a mess - needs substantial work","I've had this ring over 5 weeks now. The app is a mess. The ring takes ages to detect that I have engaged in activity. Sometimes, it takes 18-24 hours to indicate that an activity has taken place. 4/5 times, it suggests the wrong activity e.g. walking instead of cycling. Furthermore, I have stopped adding my meals. No feedback or response to any food records which I provide. What's the point? Absolutely no point. So I don't bother any more.At the end of each day - once I have uploaded my activity - I can see where I WAS stressed. What use is that??? Why not tell me WHEN I'm stressed so that I CAN DO SOMETHING about it. It's like telling someone after they have crashed their car that the car's airbags were activated 6 hours ago. What good is that?? Why not create an alert on user's phone and provide some in-the-moment solution? The Oura is a very expensive example of Cr*pGPT (Cr*p Guinea Pig Technology). Users provide all their data to help a company leverage it for product development - all for very little practical value-in-return, as far as I can see.Don't get me started on the monthly subscription...

Now, I am not unreasonable, I get that before Christmas it's usually a busy time for all companies, however it's been almost 3 weeks (I know the website /FAQs say 14 business days) but I haven't even received the email that's supposed to notify my the actual refund process had begun. 2 days ago I opened a second ticket asking what is going on, zero reply, only the useless AI chat conversation. From a company this size, which is advertising itself like OURA does, I would have never expected 3 weeks and no refund. At this point I am running out of options to get in contact with them.

"Terrible Service, Do not Order Directly from Oura","On November 30, 2024, I ordered a Oura Ring 4 Black size 12. On December 1, 2024, I was notified that my package was being shipped. I then received a notification on December 16, 2024, that my package had been delivered. That evening, I retrieved the package from my mailbox only to open the sealed box to find that there was not an Oura ring in the package. I contacted Oura Ring customer service on December 18, 2024, at 8:59 am EST to notify them of my issue. I received an automated notification via email that the member care team was looking into it and that they would respond within 24 hours. However, it has now been 4 weeks and despite the numerous emails I have sent them, I have yet to hear back from the member care team, and I am left without a resolution. And there is no customer service phone number that I can contactI am deeply upset and find this situation completely unacceptable. The missing Oura Ring, which was a significant investment ($347.95), was intended as a special Christmas gift. The fact that it has not arrived as promised has not only tarnished my impression of the Oura Ring company but also left me in a difficult position. I am now working with the Maryland State Consumer Protection division to seek legal assistance with this matter. I am also telling all of my fellow gym members, family, and friends to not purchase from this company. By far the worst customer experience I have ever received from a company. I recommend all consumers avoid purchasing from Oura.","1","2025-01-08T02:18:51.000Z","B.Carter","US","1.0"

"Theft of money and terrible customer support.","I have a terrible customer experience with that company. I bought Oura Ring (Gen 3) almost 4 years ago and still haven't received it or got my money back. First of all, I bought it in 2021 through official website. It was still possible to do it from Russia. I completed my order and paid for it. I was surprised when I received the letter which says that Oura doesn't have the approval to import hardware components to Russia. For me it was very strange because they were selling to Russia online through their official website. But ok.After almost one year of silence from their side I wrote them again and proposed two solutions: 1. They can ship it to Thailand (where I lived at that time). 2. They can ship it to Canada (where my close relatives live). But they denied both solutions and told me that they can't deliver it to another country. I asked them maybe they can cancel my order, give me some coupon/voucher and I can order it again from different country. They rejected my offer again because of their company policy. So, in total: I bought my ring almost 4 years ago and still don't have my product or my money. Oura company doesn't want to find some solutions their just stole my money and doesn't want to solve the problem. Update - 24.03.2025. Almost, three months left since I post the review here and still no reaction. Worst service ever.","1","2025-03-24T12:08:10.000Z","Anton S.","KZ","9.0"
"Completely unreliable at tracking steps","As a longtime (but jaded) user of a Fitbit, I did my due diligence with the newly released to the UK, Oura Ring and decided after reading numerous reviews to fork out the not inconsiderable sum of £400 for a new Gen 4 ring in brushed silver.Big mistake!Whilst the Oura ably tracks my sleep, heartrate and stress levels, it is absolutely terrible at tracking steps.Now I wouldn't mind if if there was was a 5-10% discrepancy in comparison to my Fitbit but it is more like 50%. Now the thing is, I know the Fitbit accurate because I can walk and watch the steps register on my Fitbit so I have pretty much complete confidence in it but you can't do that with the Oura so I wore both the ring and my faithful Fitbit tracker together for a week. Every single day the Oura was registering absurdly fewer steps than I know I had actually done. In comparison with the Fitbit those figures were on average 50% less. Where I could normally hit 10,000 pretty easily with my Fitbit, I'm lucky somedays to hit 5000 on the Oura despite regular dog walks of several miles.My advice to anybody who wants to track steps with the Oura is to give it a wide berth. Its not accurate or reliable at all and I am seriously considering returning mine and buying a much cheaper Fitbit with no monthly subscription fee.","2","2025-01-07T18:22:35.000Z","Neil B","GB","2.0"

"I purchased the Oura3 6 months ago and…","I purchased the Oura3 6 months ago and wear 24/7.   The health metrics on the ring are outstanding.   Sleep, HRV, Readiness, Activity,  etc….    Has helped my sleep and recovery both of which are invaluable to my health care.    The negative, and a big negative, is the comfort of the ring.   I have owned for 6 months and constantly rotate between 4 fingers during the day, I move at times when the level of discomfort is high.   I did reach out to Oura and they made numerous  recommendations all of which I had tried prior to reaching out - FYI contact with Oura is only via emails, no call in available.    Somewhat disappointed that the final comment from Oura: “If the ring fits well in all other aspects but still causes discomfort, we completely understand if you decide to take a break from wearing it or even stop using it altogether. Your comfort is paramount, and while the ring provides valuable health insights, it should not come at the cost of your comfort”I would suggest exploring the Oura 4 which was recently released and indicates a slimmer version.    Also, explore other brands which indicate a more comfortable fit.   Buyer beware, if it is not comfortable return immediately to Oura.","2","2025-01-05T00:16:46.000Z","JLCar","US","1.0"

"Useful but flawed","I bought my Oura to help me with my sleep, and it does a lot of things that either the Fitbit or the Apple Watch can do, such as tracking naps effectively. For this reason, I will probably keep it. However, I have a couple of concerns. One is that a subscription is necessary on top of the high cost of the ring. As far as I can tell, if I can’t afford the subscription anymore, my ring will become useless despite having shelled at £400 for it. My second concern is related and is that support is not very effective. I am paying a subscription to use this service and I would like it to be effectively supported. There is only email support, though, and a 24 hour lag at least before you get a reply. And as with every customer service outfit everywhere, they start out with a guess at what you might have asked, so you have to get back to them and the whole thing ends up taking a week. Eventually they decided my ring had a hardware issue and the whole thing needs to be replaced. This did nothing at all to change anything. Finally, weirdly there is one sleep tracking aspect that Fitbit wins on, and that is that the Oura does not show detail of how you were sleeping at different times during the night. So if you wondered what time you went to the loo, you can find that out on Fitbit, but not on this. Update: two months on and I'm still waiting for them to help me find one feature that should be in the app and is not there. That's ok, I can cope. But what does bother me a bit is that they are quite happy to spin the conversation on and on, literally forever, despite their having nothing to add or offer. They will not admit that it just doesn't work. They just ask me for more and more screenshots, tell me they are working hard to help, then every few days tell me the case is closed and was everything ok for me? It's absurd and dishonest.","3","2025-03-12T10:21:56.000Z","LoLo","GB","89.0"

"Don't waste your money","Don't waste your money, no product support. I received a version 4 ring for Christmas. When registering you must complete the billing information for the monthly service. The Oura ring address fields will not recognize Washington as a city of DC. I attempted numerous configurations, no dice. Used the on-line chat, it would not recognize my problem, just opened a ticket. Received a response, in a timely manner, requesting I try everything I already stated I had tried and did not work - clearly they had not throughly read the chat. Responded to that email indicating as much. Received a response to my email next day with exact same instructions provided earlier in the same email chain, which I already said I tried and does not work. Again searched for CS phone number, again no dice. Again interacted with the online chat function only to have the exact same thing done, open a ticket recieved the exact same worthless instructions. In this day and age, even the smallest of companies will provide direct customer service. The facts appear to be that OURA has decided to not invest in product support. That tells me they have little to no regard for their customer. So what happens if something were to go wrong if I was able to complete registration!! Don't waste your money.UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!! Updating this review as today, 1/06/2025, a week after i posted it, as someone from Oura decided to respond to it TODAY!

That being said I have a few gripes with the product that are hard to look past. I understand that it’s a luxary item and the company is trying to expend so the added monthly subscription makes sense in that regard but it still sucks when there is starting to become more competitors in the space particularly Samsung who doesn’t charge a monthly fee. My second complaint was that the ring required specific charging wattage and it didn’t come with a charger that could safely charge the ring, a minor complaint and to be expected of all tech now a days but after just one year of use the included charger stopped working and I had to buy one online and at 60ish $ that’s insane. It’s proprietary too so no looking for an offhand one. I’ll continue to use the product cause it was expensive to get into and it works well just know these things going into the investment.","3","2024-12-30T16:25:42.000Z","AWolfe","US","5.0"

"Disappointing Experience with Oura Ring and Lack of Support","I purchased the Oura ring recently, but unfortunately, I did not have a positive experience with it. I tried wearing it for less than an hour, but I felt discomfort from both the heat and what I perceived as radiation. Instead of helping with my anxiety, it actually made it worse.The website mentions a 30-day return policy, so I immediately submitted a support ticket (Ticket ID: 4281036) to initiate the return process. However, I have not received a response yet, and I couldn't find any clear instructions on how to return the ring. I also saw that Oura mentioned they are experiencing high ticket volume, which may delay responses.It would be extremely helpful if return instructions were provided directly on the website instead of making customers wait for a response from an agent.Please contact me with the return instructions and return label.","1","2024-12-11T21:00:27.000Z","Netta","IT","3.0"

Deeply regret ordering now as I have no faith in the desire or ability to support customers. update - still no response from the queries I raised using the so called customer service, but interestingly they have found resource / time to respond to this review - suggest they spend more time answering / helping customers than tracking trustpilot!","1","2024-12-09T15:04:06.000Z","Mike","GB","11.0"

"Great experience with Oura Ring and their custome support","I’m very happy with the product. It looks sleek and stylish, and the data it provides is very useful for helping me adjust my habits. The insights into my sleep patterns and activity levels are particularly useful.Compared to other fitness/well-being trackers, the Oura ring has the additional benefit of being the least intrusive. Being a ring, it is comfortable to be worn all day and all night.I’ve read quite a few negative reviews, especially regarding Oura's Customer Support, but my personal experience with the Oura Ring and their Customer Support has been excellent. I own the Oura Ring 3, and although I faced a minor battery issue, the customer service was outstanding. Once I made my claim, they sent me a replacement ring within 48 hours.","5","2024-12-05T18:18:27.000Z","Gherardo Carullo","IT","2.0"
"Non-existent customer service.","Non-existent customer service.I placed an order for an Oura 4 last week. It appears that they opt for the slowest / cheapest shipping options and they are not very transparent about timeframes (or at least they are leaving it intentionally vague). I find it unbelievable that they are allowed to not have a complaints process or a clear way to communicate with the company and instead re-direct you to FAQs and chats with BOTs which do not even function. After I placed an order and paid almost £600 (which they happily took out of my account much quicker than they sent the trial kit), and after not seeing much movement through the tracking link I received, I wanted to try and find out whether I would be likely to receive the product within a certain date. There is no email or form to fill out for customer support, which if not illegal, is still unacceptable for a product of this price range. I sent an email to their ""orders@...."" address which has a convenient (for Oura) automated response that this inbox is not monitored.This whole experience actually made me cancel my order since I have not even received the sizing kit 5BD after placing the order. They'd better be as quick in refunding me as they were in taking the money out of the account.","1","2024-12-05T13:00:06.000Z","Anastasia","GB","1.0"

They did not send tracking information. The info I had said that they were using DHL but they used the USPS.   They just delivered the ring to a street mailbox at 10pm. I can’t believe this company. I would not purchase directly from them. I would use Amazon, Target or Best Buy as they have much better delivery. I also am not sure I would have purchased this ring after this delivery and their terrible answers to questions about this order.I hope the set up goes smoothly, but I’m skeptical. Now Oura reached out, but the email that they gave in the response is not valid. SO THEIR RESPONSE IS NOT ACCURATE AND THEY ARE TRYING TO SAVE FACE.

Two weeks into my  free month trial I reached out to customer service to ask for a refund of the yearly membership so I could switch to a monthly membership instead.

The customer service is horrendous, and the product is unreliable. I highly recommend steering clear of this purchase.PS.

I sent an email to Oura about a possible battery replacement (I'd even pay for the service.) and received a reply that the email address is no longer valid an to use the ""Help Center"".After trying several times and using the automated chat (""FInn""), I got nowhere.  I just can't see replacing a ring every three years.  That adds up to over $100 a year. I'm now looking at Apple and I hear there are several new companies (EG: Ring Conn) that I'll be looking into.

I have tried for 3 weeks to get my email changed to my new email so I could order a new ring. Complete run around.

"Misleading Information, Poor Customer Service, and Unresolved Issue","I ordered a product from Ōura in October 2021, with a promise of delivery in 3-4 weeks. However, the order was never shipped. When I reached out for an explanation, Ōura claimed that sanctions imposed against Russia were preventing the shipment.The problem is that Ōura has been giving me misleading information. They claimed sanctions began in November 2021, but in reality, the first sanctions that could have impacted their operations were imposed after February 22, 2022, months after I placed my order. Additionally, the sanctions are against Russia, not individuals like me. I am not personally sanctioned, and I have been living in the UAE (a non-sanctioned country) for over two years.Ōura also claims they cannot ship my order to an alternate address or provide a refund, even though I am now living in the UAE. Their responses have been inconsistent, and their refusal to resolve the issue has raised concerns that they are acting more like scammers than a reputable company.Despite numerous attempts to communicate and resolve the issue, they have ignored my requests and failed to provide a satisfactory solution. This has been a frustrating experience, and I would strongly advise others to think twice before purchasing from Ōura, especially if they expect any transparency or accountability when issues arise.","1","2024-10-22T20:29:50.000Z","Alexander Morozov","AE","1.0"

The company takes your cash the minute you place an order and then happily sits on it for weeks at a time because they don't want to spend the money to properly resource up their order delivery teams for what is an entirely predictable surge in demand. It's such bad practice and demonstrates that they prioritise the bottom line over customer experience. Well, I no longer want to be your customer, so I've cancelled my order.

"In Love with Oura","I've had my Oura ring for almost a year and it just keeps getting better! The app and ring both updated in the last couple weeks and I am blown away! I now have the Oura advisor which is like having a personal trainer/ advisor in my pocket to answer questions. For example, some days I have trouble choosing between different workouts and have started turning to the advisor. Because it has access to the data in my app, it notices trends and patterns and can give me the best recommendation! A number of the metrics are even more accurate now such as HRV, resilience, stress, and more. I LOVE how it tracks great taste data through my workouts because, now, it breaks my heart rate down into zones! The app also has a whole new layout which I wasn't sure about but I really do like.I could go on for pages about all the reasons that I love the Oura ring and app. All I've done here is hit the highlights of the newest update. I didn't think it was possible for this to get better and it did! Oura works consistently, reliably and extremely well. I cannot recommend it highly enough. As an aside, I think Oura is an amazing testament to Finland and the Finnish people. They have truly created a product that empowers everyday people, like myself, to better understand and improve our health. It has even helped with my complex PTSD. The resilience and stress graphing are accurate and phenomenal! Thank you for creating a product, and making it affordable, that has so clearly shown how mental/emotional and physical health interact with each other!","5","2024-10-17T18:52:50.000Z","Bryoney Blakley","US","1.0"
"A Two-Year Member Completely Ignored – Disgraceful Service","After two years of being a loyal Oura member, to clarify I've had an active membership for 2+ years, I’m beyond disgusted with the customer service. You'd think that being a paying member for this long would warrant even the slightest bit of attention, but clearly, OURA couldn’t care less about its customers once they've got your money.I've reached out multiple times and was met with nothing but radio silence. For a company that markets itself as cutting-edge and customer-centric, this is absolutely pathetic. No response, no support, and zero respect for their members.I sent several emails, reached out on social media, on chat etc. If you're thinking about buying an OURA ring, take my advice: save yourself the frustration.

The biggest size they gad (13) only fit on my little finger and it felt ackward to use it there. I have written many times asking if bigger sizes were in the work but always got a ""no"" as an answer.Now finally with gen 4 bigger sizes are available, but asking customer service if an upgrade is available I received a ""no"" again. I will have to pay full price for the pleasure of finally being able to wear the ring where it should be worn.How disappointing.

They consistently go above and beyond and that only builds the trust I have with them. Their product is the best and the most beautiful, and their pricing model beats Whoop's hands down. I'll be an Ōura user for years to come! I've recommended it to several friends who have since bought one, and I've also purchased one to give to a friend.

I contacted support, and they said they would send me a new ring, but they keep delaying it because the ring is out of stock in their warehouse, and they aren’t providing any alternative. They apologized and gave me an extra 6 months on top of the subscription, but that doesn’t solve the issue with the faulty ring.","1","2024-10-16T08:44:44.000Z","Meda Mačiulaitytė","LT","1.0"
"Avoid Oura at All Costs – Terrible Customer Service and Unresolved Issues","I strongly advise against purchasing from Oura. Our experience has been nothing short of a nightmare.We ordered Oura Rings, paying nearly $1,000, but never received the package due to it being lost by UPS. Despite this, Oura has been unhelpful and continues to hold us accountable for the lost package. They refuse to issue a refund or replacement until they ""locate"" the lost shipment. To make matters worse, they offered refurbished rings as replacements, even though we paid full price for new ones. This is simply absurd and unacceptable.Their customer service has been slow, unresponsive, and dismissive, and it has now been weeks without any resolution. We've had to take matters into our own hands by disputing the charge with our credit card company.Oura's handling of this situation shows a complete disregard for their customers. I will never recommend this brand to anyone and will actively share this experience to warn others.

"Poor customer service and terrible gifting experience","Really disappointing experience trying to gift Oura Ring. Their checkout process doesn't tell you that if it's an international shipment, the receiver could have to pay customs.. The gift receiver then got the ring + a $70 bill. What a crapy gifting experience. The customer success team spend all their time blaming me for not seeing a ""customs"" notice and I've sent them screenshots of the flow and it doesn't exist on the checkout like they keep claiming. Then they have the gall to reach out and ask me to refer Oura to others. Tone deaf and absolutely dumb. A simple way of keeping a new customer is just to solve for the crappy experience. They could've just offered a free annual membership (cost of $80) to the gift receiver to really win them over. Instead they continue arguing via email and claiming the customer is the idiot. What a bunch of crap. Definitely deserve a 1 star and no referrals.","1","2024-10-12T17:17:57.000Z","Ananth","GB","5.0"

"Above and beyond experience","I reached out to costumer support in regards to my ring. This ring was a gift given to me and I explained to the team that my ring just stopped working. The team was able to run a diagnosis on my ring and determined that it was a software issue. Unfortunately, I have had this ring for around 2 years, about three years, so I had no warranty on the ring since it is only given on the first year after your purchase. Luckily, an amazing customer service representative named Bryan offered to exchange my ring at no additional cost, even with the warranty expired! He was able to guide me through the process of how the exchange would work, and I was more than satisfied! He was even able to send me a free sizing kit since my ring also did not fit me anymore due to health issues. After the sizing kit arrived, I was able to reach out to customer service again, and the attention was unmatched. Erwin was able to help me through the process of ordering the exchange ring; he was very patient, and thoughtful. It was a very pleasant experience. I have to give the Oura Costumer Service team a 100/10.","5","2024-10-10T22:57:48.000Z","Gilbeli Girodier","CA","1.0"
"Get a device from somewhere else.","I just dont know if I trust this company. The product is incredibly expensive and I havent been able to get support. My roommate was able to exchange her ring for the new generation no problem and I have yet to get a response. Additionally, I was having troubles with the app and there has been no response there either. I bought my ring through amazon (only because oura's website HSA Payment portal does not work and hasnt for a long time) and when I reached out to them about the exchange they acted as a completely separate entity and denied the exchange even though ouras website would allow it. Oura shouldnt advertise external sellers on their site if they dont abide by the company's policies. Additionally, if it was their fault that I couldn't get it from their website in the first place, I shouldn't be responsible for that. It needs to be more consistent. I've heard and seen so many people struggling to get proper help and support from customer service and it just doesn't seem worth it. 400-500 dollars is a lot to invest when there are plenty of other devices on the market. If they want to compete with apple they need to be more reliable. I wish I had never bought one.

Does Oura Health Ltd (natively Oura Health Oy) has a cash-flow problem and using the clients payment as cash needed for production of the items?2. Is Oura Health Ltd (natively Oura Health Oy) running a pyramidal financial scheme using the new clients payments to reimburse the previous clients (too many!!!) that request previous orders cancelation and reimbursement?3.

"More data would be beneficial","I’ve been using your product for some time now and have enjoyed it quite a bit. I initially chose it because of its reputation as one of the most accurate sleep trackers and, secondly, because the design is sleek and attractive, unlike many other bulky devices.However, after extended use, I find that it doesn’t provide enough data for my needs, and I don’t want to rely on an additional app for more insights. For instance, I also use the RISE app, which calculates sleep depth and provides energy peaks and dips based on wake-up times—data that is missing from Oura. I believe integrating such features would greatly enhance the product's value.Here are three suggestions I think would improve Oura:Sleep Depth and Energy Patterns: Adding sleep depth analysis and energy level tracking throughout the day would provide more insight into sleep quality. It would also eliminate the need for users to use additional paid apps like RISE for this data.Smart Alarm Integration: A smart alarm feature that wakes users at the most optimal time, based on their sleep cycle, would be highly beneficial. For instance, allowing the user to set a latest wake-up time, and the app waking them up at the best point within their sleep cycle, would improve the overall experience.Customizable Insights and Feedback: Adding an option for users to input how they feel throughout the day (e.g., energy levels, mood) and giving recommendations (e.g., when to stop drinking coffee) would offer more personalized feedback and allow Oura to collect data that could enhance future analyses.As someone with nearly a decade of experience in brand management and startups, I believe these improvements would make Oura even more powerful. I hope this feedback helps in your product development, and I look forward to seeing future updates. Thank you for the work you're doing!","4","2024-10-07T10:47:53.000Z","Julianna Bebre","LV","1.0"

"Great health tracking tool and customer support","I've been wearing an Oura ring for over 2 1/2 years now and have found it very helpful in tracking sleep patterns and overall activity level as well as noting symptoms such as asthma flares and migraines, common colds, etc. The temp monitor is great and measures mild fevers following vaccinations (yay interferon!) or illness. I use a Garmin for running, hiking, and swimming, which syncs data nicely with Oura. More recently I'm finding it helpful in tracking perimenopause, the other side of cycle monitoring. After noticing the ring battery decreasing from close to 7 days down to 2ish days, a quick check-in with customer service has resulted in them sending me a replacement ring, no hassles, and very prompt communication which I appreciate. I know some people balk at the $6/month fee after the first 6 months, but given this level of support and their ongoing R&D efforts to add new functionality, I think it's a worthwhile investment and will continue wearing my Oura for the foreseeable future!","5","2024-10-01T23:52:10.000Z","Karin Thacker","US","1.0"

It’s been more than 2 weeks since i last heard from them and in the meantime the membership fee can’t be cancelled. Very disappointed. And it’s more so now that i see so many unhappiness with their customer service. It seems there is no further escalation to this unresponsive customer service.

Despite purchasing the product a long time ago while residing in Russia, I encountered shipping constraints that prevented delivery. Now, having relocated to the UK, the customer support team has persistently refused to ship the product or provide a refund to any bank account. Since relocating to the UK, I have reached out to customer support multiple times asking for a resolution, only to be refused each time. Their only offer was a $50 token for a discount on a future purchase, which, considering the circumstances, is no consolation as I will not be making any further purchases from themThis level of inflexibility and lack of customer care is appalling and has left me feeling incredibly frustrated and disheartened. I advise potential customers to be cautious when dealing with Oura Ring, as their after-sales support is severely lacking.my order number is SO-10541461","1","2024-09-27T12:24:16.000Z","Ася Стеценко","RU","1.0"

It's now 26th September I've had no replies, I spent £300 and theres no humans to talk to, no phone number or access via the live chat.So they have taking my money, not delivered a product and won't respond to any emails. It's left my feeling quite anxious and worried they just not going to reply and take my money.This is the first time I've ever left a review in my life, that's how bad this experience has been. I've now canceled the item but got no confirmation or told how long the process will take.This is a tech company gone wrong.Update: Received an automated email to confirm refund has been processed, but doesn't say how long it will take so suppose I will just keep checking my account every morning till I get it..","1","2024-09-26T16:14:28.000Z","Jason","GB","1.0"

Jonathan and the team were exceptional in corresponding with me during the process and still as I am waiting for a second ring for my wife. We can’t wait to be able to compare daily data on our health. There is so much more to the new Oura ring and we are really excited to discover the new data that is now available. We both have membership and consider it very good value for money. My wife changed from an Apple watch to an Oura ring because the watch was causing an inflammation on her skin under the watch.

"Excruciatingly terrible customer service and product","Both the ring and customer service are dysfunctional crap.  Beware of the five star reviews here, they all look fake due to lack of specific info and that most of them have only one review.  The first Oura ring I ordered -- Heritage style - was not comfortable and the gold looked bronze not gold.  I returned within 30 days for the Horizon style (no angles) in Rose Gold, it arrived in unsealed box with two scratches on the ring.  I tried it and like it and figured I could like with the scratches as they were on side and underneath so not visible.  3 days after the 30 day return period, the ring malfunctions and won't download my info.  A few days later the charger malfunctions and constantly blinks orange and does not charge the ring. I look at online reviews and this blinking orange has been a problem for YEARS.  I am now trying to return the malfunctioning ring that was sent to me used and scratched.  On my sixth email to the company and still no progress.  Honestly do not buy it. My husband thinks it's a scam and is quite happy using his Apple Watch for health/activity/sleep info. Unfortunately I just cannot sleep with a watch on my wrist.  I just don't understand how any company gets away with with such dire service and products.","1","2024-09-24T02:34:02.000Z","SFMOM3","US","15.0"

"Unreliable Performance and Poor Customer Service","I had high hopes for the Oura Ring and was excited to track my health more closely. However, since purchasing the ring, I’ve experienced recurring issues with the app not providing readiness scores and what seems like partial syncing. As a result, I regularly miss out on important data. I’ve contacted Oura’s customer support about this issue, but their response is painfully slow. Each time, I’ve had to go through a lengthy and frustrating process of deleting the app, turning my phone on and off, reinstalling the app, and resetting everything just to get it working temporarily. It’ll function for a few weeks, but then the same problem arises, and I have to repeat the entire process. For a £450 ring, on top of a monthly subscription, this is extremely disappointing. I really wanted to love this product and recommend it, but the constant technical issues and slow customer service have left me feeling ripped off. Sadly, I can’t recommend it in its current state.","2","2024-09-23T16:45:57.000Z","Hannah","GB","3.0"
"Excellent customer service that really thinks along","Overall, the rings are of excellent quality and have really shifted my behaviours over the past few years of wearing an Oura ring. But in addition to the excellent quality of the ring and insights it provides, Oura's customer service deserves specific attention.  I've been in contact several times with Oura's customer service, including recently when I had a medical incident. The customer service team went above and beyond each time thinking along with me, and taking my issue(s) seriously. I felt like a valued customer and like my issues were heard, and my issues were resolved efficiently every time, and the Oura team was very accommodating. Other companies should take note of Oura's customer service processes and approaches, far more human and solution oriented!","5","2024-09-23T13:14:50.000Z","Laura","NL","1.0"

"Very poor support","Less than a day after I activated my ring, it stopped working, ie synching was completely dead. It took a week for their customer service team to acknowledge that their troubleshooting does not work. They said their warranty team will reach out, and I still have not heard from them. As a customer service professional, I think this is an extremely poor experience which makes me think the product is 💩 too. Unfortunately, I can’t say anything good or bad about the ring because it was not working 😡Upd: Oura care team tries to leave an impression that they care by leaving a comment here, but in reality I still have not heard back 2 days later - neither from support nor from warranty team. With a monthly app charge issues like this one has to be taken care of immediately, not a week or two later (or who knows how long).

"We are in NZ and ordered an ŌURA ring…","Hi there this is a follow up from Original review.  I got a reply from you guys on this site and you said someone will contact me re my concerns, still nothing.  I have now cancelled my order for the ring and cannot see how I can cancel the membership, a lot of hoops to just through to get into the right box and wont accept my email address etc to login in.  Anyway have not received any communication from Oura at all over all of this except Bot messages.  I have spent a lot of money and trusted Oura to be reputable , how wrong was I! We are in NZ and ordered an ŌURA ring from the Oura website 10 days ago and ordered the sizing rings.  Paid in full for the ring and membership.  We received an email to say our orders were received and we would get email re the sizing rings delivery.  WE have had nothing except their regular newsletters etc.  When I messaged to ask what is happening I get the bot reply to say should get reply in 24 hours.  Nothing for 3 days now.  I sent more messages and then just get standard message with ticket number from Anna?? Who is obviously not a person as she does not answer my question just gives me another ticket number and has escalated my request and finding someone with expertise to  address the complexities of my case!  I just want to know if and when it will be sent, not complicated at all, just standard procedure when I have purchased something I would have thought! Communication terrible from them.  Will be cancelling my order in the next 24 hours if not updated.  I did not realise it would be this hard.

"At Oura Ring","At Oura Ring, they always make me feel like a valued part of the family. The only down side is sometimes customer service is a bit slow.  However everything else is top notch, from the hardware (Ring) to the platform (Oura App) the services (features offered) Samsung & Apple are breaking into this market, I have no plans to switch.  Innovative Features like Oura Advisor (AI Technology) intuitive without being intrusive nor overbearing. 2 years 8 months and going. I would have left this review on Facebook, but I am not giving them tracking permissions.","5","2024-09-10T03:23:16.000Z","Albert","US","1.0"

My ring recently just stopped working and I tried to do the troubleshooting they suggested, which ended up logging me out of my app permanently because my ring will not connect. I tried to start and inquiry with that little AI robot thing but it was a huge issue because I couldn't get the information it was asking for because my app completely locked me out. Also, the only response i’ve gotten from Oura is them telling me that the email my ticket inquiry was sent to is no longer in service. I’m actually writing this review as a last ditch effort to get help.","2","2024-09-09T18:28:40.000Z","Izzy Fee","US","1.0"

Consistently drops 2+ hours of sleep at the start of sleep cycle.  My Apple Watch, while it does little analysis with the data, is far more accurate than the oura ring. Step counts are also significantly overstated, skewing other analysis.  Buyer beware!Adding on 9/11.

The last few weeks the battery wasn't holding a charge for more than a day and many nights I got no sleep data because the battery died in the night. I emailed support to ask about this, fully expecting to be told my ring was out of warranty and that's what happens when the ring gets old. Much to my surprise, that is not what I was told. They said they identified an issue with my ring and I was offered $75 off a new ring of any model, or I could opt to receive a restored ring, same model as the one I have. I was amazed!! My ring is out of warranty but because I am a member of the Oura community, I was offered this one time exception. This is customer service at it's finest.

"AVIOD !!","I have been an Oura ring customer since the beginning in 2020.  The battery life in these rings (including the new GEN3) is extremely short , no matter how careful you are in charging it.  My first GEN3 ring was replaced due to battery issues with no problem.  However my most recent ring also developed battery issues and Oura told me over a month ago that is was being replaced since it was still under warranty.  Whenever I try to contact them (email only, that is the only option), they give me a new ticket number and inform me that the ring is on its way.  It should not take a month to send a ring!!  Additionally,  I question the accuracy of the metrics such as sleep score, readiness, heart rate variability, and ""resilience"".  They don't really correlate well with how I feel and I have been using the ring for over 4 years.  I find that the information is not very actionable.  For example , it may say ""your heart rate variability is below your baseline for the past 7 days"".  I dont change anything and the HRV goes back to its ""baseline"".","1","2024-08-24T15:45:57.000Z","Customer","US","2.0"

I am 38 and feel better than I did in my 20s and Oura has a lot to do with that! I’ve tried Apple Watch and Fitbit, both weren’t as accurate or comfortable to wear while sleeping.

"Purchased my ring on 1/23/24","Purchased my ring on 1/23/24, and contacted Oura in May as the finish was completely gone from the ring. After pictures and multiple back and forth they blamed Best Buy, and said I’d need to take it up with them. After months of back and forth with Best Buy, they have reiterated time and time again that only Oura can send me a return authorization number and/or file a warranty claim. Best Buy has nothing to do with that. Since contacting them in May, the ring has essentially stopped charging at all. So I have a $500 useless item that’s only 9 months old, and ouras customer service has been an absolute joke to deal with. I’ll be filling a claim with my credit card company next, as this is absolutely ridiculous.","1","2024-08-21T23:13:02.000Z","Ashley Yibale","US","1.0"

It is nice to be able to wear my ring after it is charged for 5 to 7 days most cases last me five days. On 1 work day I walk anywhere from 13 to 26 miles. As it is very light weight and durable. Only device I found I can you at work in correctional setting law enforcement and does not set off metal dector. Also tracks lots of stuff like other devices, but other device post security concerns because have GPS/ text/ and phone calls as I can not wear at work.

"Disappointing Customer Service Experience","I've been a happy Oura user for quite some time, even purchasing two rings over the years. However, my experience took a turn for the worse about two months ago when I started experiencing pain in the finger where I wore my ring. Upon inspecting the ring, I discovered a possible issue that might be causing the discomfort.I reached out to Oura's customer support, who initially responded and asked if I would prefer a replacement ring or a refund. I opted for a replacement, but unfortunately, the new ring has yet to be shipped, and my follow-up emails have gone unanswered.As a loyal customer, I'm deeply disappointed by the lack of communication and resolution. I was very satisfied with the product until this point, but the unresponsiveness is making me question Oura's commitment to their customers. I hope this review prompts Oura to address these issues, as their product has great potential, but the customer service needs significant improvement.","1","2024-08-18T15:33:40.000Z","Juraj Bulava","MY","2.0"

Oura refunded my item and listened to my concerns about not knowing where my package went.

"Lightning fast, no hassle replacement","After experiencing a battery issue, Oura responded swiftly and sent out a replacement under my warranty with very little effort on my part. I am impressed and will be able to recommend Oura ring with even more confidence now. I purchased my Oura ring just under 2 years ago and have absolutely loved it. Recently, it seemed like the battery life was less efficient than it had been but I did not think much of it until on August 7 I received a notification from the app to charge my ring before bed. This was odd as I had fully charged the ring just that morning. I opened the app and found that the ring battery was extremely low. I fully charged it and put it back on around 8pm. I went to bed later that night and woke up in the around 2am with a headache. I opened my Oura app to see if I had any alerts about my temperature, and found that the ring had died. I put it back on the charger and went back to sleep. When I woke up around 6am EST, I googled the issue and saw someone posting about how they received a replacement with a similar issue when they were under warranty still. I couldn't remember how long my warranty was when I purchased it, but I went to the help feature in the Oura app and followed the steps with the AI help chat. It walked me through a simple process after saying that the app detected a battery issue with the ring and while retrieving some of the requested information and I found my warranty email from my purchase stating that the ring has a two year warranty. It turned out that my warranty's expiration date was just 10 days away. The help ticket was sent and I received a confirmation email saying I would receive a response within 24 hours about the next steps. The next day, I awoke to find that Oura support had responded saying they would replace my ring AND I had another email notifying me that the replacement had already been shipped and would arrive in three days. Since I use Oura ring paired with Natural Cycles, this quick turnaround is incredible and appreciated. I feel 100% taken care of as a customer and believe the value of Oura's product is increased by the simple fact that they stand by their quality standards and actually make it easy to activate the warranty when an issue arises.","5","2024-08-10T02:31:57.000Z","Anna Caton","US","1.0"

That all being said, I find the metrics that are provided to be very useful, even though I grumble a lot.  When the battery started acting up and barely made it through a full day without running out of juice, I contacted them and they ran a remote test on the ring and determined that the battery had failed and told me that they would replace it without charge. However, it is a one-time warranty repair and the ring will no longer be covered in the future.  The response was fast and the people were very helpful in getting a resolution and doing it quickly without need to get lots of up-line approvals. I am always impressed by companies who empower their customer service people to resolve issues for their customers.  My only quibble at this point is that I wish I could purchase a yearly plan for the app, rather than pay full price every month.","4","2024-08-09T06:29:33.000Z","Don “By-tor” Hamilton","US","1.0"

I must add this is the first time I have ever posted an online review on anything ever. I do this hoping to save someone else the grief and waste of time and most importantly Money.

"Horrendous returns & exchange policy","Horrendous returns & exchange policy. Ordered the ring sizer and was torn between two sizes (they really need to do half sizes). Ordered the larger size based on their FAQs. The ring arrived but it was far too big - much bigger than the ring sizer I’d tried. I sent it back to exchange for the smaller size. The new small ring arrived but it was far too tight! I couldn’t get it on any of my fingers. So I tried to start a return request for a refund because none of the sizes I tried would fit properly, however, because I had already exchanged it one, I’m now not allowed to send it back for a refund! This seems utterly crazy to me - how was I to know that the smaller size would not fit at all, even after trying the ring sizer. So not I’m £300 out of pocket because I have an item I can’t use! How are they allowed to have such a backwards returns policy!","1","2024-07-22T21:24:33.000Z","Emily B","GB","1.0"

"Battery degrading / planned obsolescence","EDIT: This was a firmware issue and I freaked out because of the timing of it all. The battery still doesn't last as long as I would like but I understand that battery technology is limited. It now last 1 - 3 days I'm having a similar experience with the battery except i only had a 1 year warranty, literally few days after the warranty expired the battery started going down hill. It still charges and has a bit of life in it but if it keeps degrading by this rate it only last a few months max. It seems all too convenient and reeks of planned obsolescence, especially since SO many people have had the same experience (there's reddit threads full of it)The responses to the reviews regarding the batteries here are super frustrating and show how bad this company is, of course batteries degrade over time but if your selling a product for such a insane ammount of money ensure it is able to be repaired not just obsolete. It also is a shocking business stratergy if for every persons whos ring dies, them plus how ever many other people they told boycott oura. Hopefully the samsung ring doesn't have the same problem.

"Bad product, bad customer service, bad experience","Initially, the product worked well. After 6 to 8 months, I experienced major issues with heart rate detection. Customer service informed me that it was a software update issue and that I needed to be patient. After waiting 4 months, I requested a refund and/or an exchange. I was then told that the problem was not with the product, but likely a contraindication with my fingers. They reluctantly offered a refund. Some time later, the sensor started working more or less well again. After 1 year and 6 months, the battery was definitively out of service. Customer service informed me that they would do nothing except offer a 70$ voucher. Oura lost a happy customer and gained a dissatisfied one. I'm taking the time to warn others, so be cautious with your purchase and be prepared to pay for a new ring every 2 years. Apparently, the subscription is not enough for this company, which should better review its priorities and focus on its customers, rather than wasting time with legal procedures against competitors who are likely doing better. I do not recommend it.Edit 12/08/24: After sending an email the 30 july and more informations to Oura, the customer service said they will exchange under warranty the ring. But, today, I received a message from the Warranty agent they said no exchange under Warranty. Here is the customer service you will get when purchasing an Oura product.

They don't last more than two years and if they do it's no longer warrantied. That means they don't stand behind their product and you're spending basically $150 per year for the 2yrs it's good for. Then they switched over to charging for the app if you weren't one of the original buyers. They only care about the bottom dollar, their customer support is trash, and honestly the cost vs the value is not there. You can't lift weights with the ring because it will scratch so it is really only for sleep.I bought a Galaxy watch that has far more functionality and make more sense just to use that.

While probably existing users giving it could be one of the best ways for Oura to grow. In summary, beware when thinking about buying for someone else 1) giving prepaid subscription together with the ring as a gift is not possible 2) paying for another member is possible via Paypal or card so that another person has to create the account and then you have to put your payment details to his/her account, absurd approach for a modern healthtech company 3) activating the ring without starting subscription trial is not possible.

Will look for what others provide soon, as at this price tag and with their non existent support after sale, I am a disappointment customer.","1","2024-03-09T20:46:09.000Z","Gianluca Brusotti","IE","1.0"
"Worst customer service ever","Worst customer service ever! After my wife waiting 3 weeks for her ring she had been given 3 months free membership and was to be refunded shipping cost. Instead, they canceled her order! Now their resolution is to give her a $75 discount if she reorders. So, wait another 3+ weeks and still pay shipping charges and full price membership for their errors? This is not acceptable. Not a good company to do business with. I canceled my membership too.

"Excellent all around","I've had an Oura ring since mid 2021. The ring has worked extremely well and provided helpful information. Customer service has been exceptional.I purchased the ring to help with sleep tracking, as at the time I was dealing with severe insomnia and fatigue. Feedback from my Oura ring helped me to understand differences between my perceptions of wakefulness and my physiological rest/wake times. This was invaluable as I used behavioral, environmental, and pharmacological interventions to build better sleep. Information from my ring has become better over time as well, with more nuanced feedback over the years. I assume this comes both from improvements in Oura's algorithms and from longitudinal data from my own ring. My sleep and health are now much improved thanks in part to feedback from my Oura ring. Beyond sleep tracking, the information Oura provides has been interesting, though not life-changing. I'm grateful for some of the insights about which days of the week I tend to have more inactive time, and the temperature sensor has been informative at times that I have been ill.My experience with customer service has been outstanding. First, I was fortunate to receive an upgrade from gen 2 to gen 3 due to the timing of my initial purchase. The timing and offer for upgrade were purely lucky on my part, but really awesome on the part of Oura. Then, just recently (after 2.5 years of use), I experienced some battery longevity issues with my ring. I contacted Oura customer service online, and they replaced my ring immediately and free of charge.In summary, my Oura ring has been well worth it to me. The functionality has been extremely beneficial to my health, and their customer service has been extraordinary.","5","2024-02-18T17:55:11.000Z","Beth Ann Turner","US","1.0"

Not only is this so-called 'smart' ring a blatant knockoff of higher quality products, but it's also trash from China.

The sleep tracking is wildly inaccurate, often mistaking moments of restlessness for deep sleep, leaving me feeling misled and frustrated. Additionally, the activity tracking is laughable, as it fails to accurately capture my steps and activity levels, making it essentially useless for monitoring my fitness progress.

"Probably, the worst customer service in the world","Edit: Changed to 4 stars because they eventually resolved the issue and I received the replacement ring. Only buy if you will never interact with customer support. What will happen with the smallest question - you will get in an endless email chain. Every answer will be a “non-answer” seemingly written with someone who has vague understanding of English. But it will always end with the friendly “Let us know if you have any other questions!”. I have now been waiting for my replacement ring (clearly confirmed by Oura that it will be delivered in the end of 2021) for TWO AND A HALF years. I exchange some 50 emails once a year, then get tired and then try again. This time they confirmed that the ring has been sent out. They sent a tracking number (that did not work). Then they promised to send a new tracking number. Then they asked for my address 4 times. Then they said that they will send another ring. Then, two days ago, they wrote that they have never sent out the replacement ring. The customer support is either outsourced to people with lacking English, or it’s a very poor AI. Given a chance, I would never buy the ring again.","4","2024-08-07T12:17:19.000Z","Alice","SE","6.0"
"Lemon Oura Ring: Cautionary Tale & BUYER BEWARE","My experience with the Oura Ring has been marred by a series of issues that have left me thoroughly dissatisfied. Two weeks after my initial purchase, I encountered problems with the battery life, which was consistently lasting only 30-36 hours despite the advertised claim of 7 days.Concerned about the discrepancy, I promptly requested a replacement. To my dismay, I was told that the battery was functioning within acceptable parameters and that the variation in battery life depended on individual usage patterns and the selected modes. It's worth noting that I was only using the ring for sleep tracking at that time. In every correspondence, I explicitly noted my request for a replacement.Despite this early red flag, I continued to face persistent challenges with sleep tracking accuracy. Each attempt to address the issue and request a replacement, clearly noting the need for a replacement due to the ongoing sleep tracking problems, was met with resistance from Oura's customer support.My saga with the Oura Ring took a turn for the worse in July 2023 when my ring began randomly failing to track my sleep. This prompted a series of interactions with customer support that only added to my mounting frustration.After a lot of back-and-forth, in September 2023, I was finally informed that the sleep tracking issue was a ""known issue"" and that the company was actively working on a resolution. However, it wasn't until January 4, 2024, that I received an email claiming the problem had been resolved and instructing me to update my ring.Unfortunately, the latest update proved ineffective, and the situation escalated. Customer support guided me through a series of steps, including taking screenshots, in an attempt to troubleshoot. Regrettably, these efforts rendered my ring completely non-functional, and the ring now refuses to connect to the app.Astoundingly, despite the ongoing and unresolved issues, the company maintained that my Oura Ring was now out of warranty. Today their proposed solution remained a meager $75 off a new purchase, a response that does little to address the persistent problems and the impact on my overall experience. They refuse to acknowledge that the problem starting in July has not been resolved, and that I requested a replacement every step of the way.This extended ordeal with the Oura Ring has left me not only with a malfunctioning device but also with a sense of disappointment in the company's ability to deliver reliable products and satisfactory customer support. Potential customers should approach the Oura Ring with caution, considering alternative options with a more proven track record and responsive support. A strong buyer beware is warranted. If you do decide to purchase the Oura Ring, and encounter issues early on, it's imperative to insist on a replacement. My experience revealed that the company may run you in circles, offering resistance and delaying tactics until the warranty period expires. It's essential to advocate for your rights as a consumer and seek a resolution promptly to avoid prolonged frustrations and potential lapses in warranty coverage.","1","2024-01-18T09:09:04.000Z","Jessie S","US","1.0"
"Good idea, badly priced","Long time fan of the OURA ring idea... Had my eyes on it for ages, but refused due to the Membership for data policy. The Good:Excellent ring, light weight, well designed and surprising to have all the sensors needed in it. The buying process was excellent. In the UK we don't have bestbuy, so we have to order the sizers when we buy our ring. The Bad:The ring is £383.28 in the UK (with current conversion) and that is before import tariffs of £81.98 are added (because the company do not correctly file UK VAT). So a total of £405.26 for a ring with the same features as a £250 smart watch. But there is more. Then you have to pay £5.99 a month just to use that data properly. Including preventing you from importing that data into other apps unless you pay. This is clearly a money making scheme and close to a scam holding your data ransom... Except that they give you the ability to download the data manually. The Ugly:A year of owning the ring will set you back £405.26 + £71.88... Think about that before you buy the ring. For some people this will be a valid price, for others the *hidden membership fee and shipping tariff will make it unviable.*Technically not hidden, it does show up on their site, but it isn't well sign posted well enough and the tariff was not highlighted at all. Personally, I am keeping the ring and considering it a sunk cost. I will return to update this review if anything spectacular or shocking happens. I am still unsure if I will continue with the membership.Edit same day: Decided to contact Oura support with the points raised, will feed back if anything is responded to.","1","2024-01-16T15:31:06.000Z","William John MacLeod Fraser","GB","28.0"
"I give it two stars because the sleep…","I give it two stars because the sleep tracking seems to be very accurate.The activity tracking is off by a lot, 25-50% undercounts of walking distance/steps. I got this as a gift, sized to my ring finger. They did send a sizing plastic rings box. When I found the activity tracker underperforming, I ordered an exchange for an index finger ring, which is their recommended because of the shape relative to the knuckle. It didn’t make a difference.I contacted them to return for a refund after two weeks of activity and no improvement.I didn’t know about their one ring only exchange policy, that was my fault.I could potentially keep it as a sleep monitor only,  but not by paying a monthly membership.My recommendation is that if your ring doesn’t work well, return it for a full refund; and then start the process again with a new purchase if you want to try a different size.Versus, trying a different brand if the first one doesn’t work well (chances are the next one will be the same).","2","2024-01-14T21:53:14.000Z","alvaro segura","US","1.0"

It decides that I'm asleep at times I know I am not asleep but just laying still so amount of sleep time overrated. It reported oxygen and breathing every day for a few months and then became inconsistent and reported most days, but not all days. Some days there will be no report and then the next day the previous day's report will magically show up or not. The battery does not last up to 7 days as they say, mine only has lasted till 4 days later from time it was new. Also, I'm pretty sure I didn't get the color I ordered.

"Worst Customer Experience Possible","I was gifted an Oura ring over a year ago by a friend. For the last two months, I have been experiencing a degraded battery that now lasts two days or less when it's supposed to last 4-5 days.I've reached out to customer support, and they recognize that my ring is defective and is suffering from a well-known battery issue on their product.The ridiculous part came when they requested the exact information that the person who offered me the ring used at checkout. As it's obvious, this is something that I do not have, nor can I ask since it was a gift. With my ring serial number, they could quickly get that information. Still, they will only provide me with support or replacement once I give this information (which I don't have).This is the type of support you can expect with Oura. Even when they recognize an issue with your ring, they will do anything to avoid going forward with a replacement and use any possible tricks to avoid any responsibility.","1","2024-01-07T12:09:51.000Z","JoS","PT","5.0"

LWhen you first start using the app you get addicted to the stats and that in itself can be a great driver to make changes and push yourself.For me though, when I first bought my ring there was no mandatory subscription and this was forced upon me.... Having been an ardent user for a year I subscribed.A year later, the ring stops recording most of my data.. It doesnt matter that I lost weight and the ring turns on my finger so the sensor doesn't pick up my pulse etc, at the end of the day it is just a ring.I cancelled my membership and now even my data is no longer available.Not a great purchase in my view, technically amazing but a waste of money","1","2023-12-25T01:51:36.000Z","Mal Snaize","NZ","2.0"
"Really awful customer service","Really awful customer service.  You will notice that if you purchase directly from the oura website they actually have not immediate phone or email contact.  You have to submit a ticket on their website and someone will get back to you after 24 hours.  I had ordered the horizon but turned out it was the heritage, I tried desperately to contact anyone to see if they could change it before it got shipped out.  Didn’t get there in time, so the wrong ring arrived.  I let them know I was disappointed.  Tried to process a return on site, got an error code, wrote back and got a link to register my return, I requested a return to be picked up by DHL only to have a message say the return didn’t go through but the paperwork was drawn up.  I ended emailing the help contact, didn’t hear back so printed the paperwork and dropped it off at dhl.  Then oura got back to me to say, by the way, you didn’t follow the process because your return didn’t process despite all the paperwork getting generated but we will still refund you but not for the shipping amount.  For a high tech product, their customer service website is not high tech at all.  What a nightmare!","1","2023-12-24T07:21:54.000Z","renee chu","CA","1.0"

I do not find the larger size to be any more comfortable, it is heavy and bulky to wear and I am generally not happy with it. They are now telling me I can not return the ring because I have exchanged it once and it falls outside their return policy. The fact that a large company like Oura has such a poor return policy is absolutely ridiculous! No other tech company, that I have ever dealt with, has such a sorry excuse for a return policy. It is also nearly impossible to get ahold of someone at this company. Beware when buying an Oura ring!!!","1","2023-12-23T18:49:11.000Z","Andrew Trempe","US","4.0"

"Hidden fees and battery issues","I’ve been an Oura user for almost 3 years. Sadly I’ve had battery issues every year and had to change the ring twice which was painful but efficiently dealt with by the team at Oura. Although the reissue of the ring happens fairly smoothly this is simply not enough for a super premium (and super expensive) product. This process heavily impacts your data tracking as your ring battery dying and replacements will create huge gaps in your health monitoring.Nevertheless I’ve decided to give Oura another chance. I have bought my wife a brand new Gen3 but unfortunately I have rapidly learned things hadn’t changed at all.The ring shipped but I have just been asked to pay £56 in custom fees by DHL which I obviously am refusing to pay as the ring cost is already important and cannot sustain an extra fee like this. Surely the tax fees have to be covered by the seller. Or at least this heavy cost needs to be flagged clearly and loudly at the moment of buying the ring.This feels very cheeky and unfair, makes me feel like the company just wants your money and is ready to cut corners to get there. My situation is pretty awkward now because Oura is not answering my emails and DHL is demanding a heavy custom fee. I sincerely hope this heartfelt and sincere review catches their attention and solve this issue before Christmas. Otherwise I’ll end up with a wife without Christmas present under the tree. Goes without saying that I should have probably checked trust pilot before buying another ring. Didn’t realise Oura is rated 1.8 stars which is a worrying score if you want to deal with it as a consumer. Hopefully things will improve and the customer service can amend to this rather uncomfortable situation.","1","2023-12-19T12:24:09.000Z","Ugo Galelli","GB","4.0"

I think maybe 10 days went by after sending a mail to support till the new ring was in my mailbox, which came today. It was easy to set up the new ring and ""delete"" the old one.

"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE","Summary:  Customer service is like chatting to a bot.  No empathy, non-apologetic, and far from what one would expect from a premium product based on wellness.Detail:  Got gifted a ring in a style not to my liking.  Received the sizing kit and decided on a size.  Contacted their CS regarding wanting to change style/color.  Took 5 days to get a response (which was understandable due to the holiday).  However, I was advised they can't modify the order and the only option is to cancel and refund the original payment method.  Can't do a credit for me to apply towards a new purchase either.Poor practice with having a gifting structure aside.  Their customer service rep never apologized for the inconvenience, showed zero empathy, and just keep on repeating ""The only option is to cancel the order for the refund, which will be received in the form of payment used to purchase.""  I initially thought about giving the gift I got to a different family member and buying my own ring.  However, the lack of empathy from the customer service representative made it clear this company doesn't care about their customers.  So ""the only option"" it is and I requested to cancel the order.To add to this, trying to cancel the order through their website resulted in the error ""Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again later."".  I'm still awaiting confirmation on the refund and hope the gift giver gets his money back.","1","2023-12-01T22:11:54.000Z","TL","US","1.0"

The amount of detail that oura provides for sleep tracking gives me everything I need to understand my body and health and I use it every day to navigate and have improved my sleep and physical ability a lot with the knowledge oura provides me.The customer service is amazing, quick responses the few times I have needed assistance, very friendly and they provide a solution instantly. When my ring malfunctioned after 1,5 years if working perfectly they instantly sent me a new one. I am very satisfied.It saddens me that people are leaving bad reviews simply for a subscription that first of all is not very expensive and secondly secures a quality that in my opinion exceeds other sleep trackers and constantly developing and implementing new features.

Summer caused my hands to swell which is normal and I could not remove the ring withour great effort, pain and numbness. I was told they only offer a 30 day exchange period for ring sizes, despite my issues with the summer heat which was not detected in the first month of ring wear. The ring is not round. It has three large sensors inside the ring and this creates a lock on your finger that makes it difficult to remove. I truly believe this is a poor design and should be redesigned. They offered me a 10% discount to buy a new $400 ring. The also charge $6 a month for their app which you must have to get any level of stats. The app also does not track continuous pulse ox, so it will not iomport this data into Apple to be used by other apps  like Snorelab. For these reasons, I wasted and through my $400 ring in the trash can. I bought a Ringconn ring. I have not tried it yet, but they have a free app for life and it costs about $100 less, has a better design internally and I have been in contact with customer service several times already who are polite, fast and accurate with information so far.","1","2023-10-22T15:25:28.000Z","Scott Cerreta","US","2.0"

"I have been using Oura ring for over 6…","I have been using Oura ring for over 6 years. I had the Bulky Gen 1 and upgraded to the Gen 2 on pre release. I have found it to be an excellent product and service up until I got my Gen 3. I upgraded purely to have a ring with a better battery life. I did not realize that after the 1 month free membership you would be restricted to the most basic data scores. I have contacted them multiple times to ask them to treat my Gen 3 ring as a Gen 2 as I don’t need any of the new features. They were sympathetic but said their hands are tied. They offered me an additional three months free membership which I accepted but I will be discontinuing my relationship with Oura after this. I have recommened Oura to many friends and colleagues but I would jot do so now. Initially they offered me free Membership for life if I upgraded my Gen 2 to a Gen 3 on pre release but my Gen 2 was still new and I also did not have the funds to do so at that time nor did I see a reason why. Now I see why. They should have been more clear that service is greatly reduced when you update your ring i you don’t have a membership also. It has left a very bad taste in my mouth.","1","2023-10-19T12:31:44.000Z","stephen ward","IE","1.0"

"A Loyal Customer's Disappointment with Oura's New Paywall Strategy","I've been a devoted Oura customer for four years and have recommended the ring to many friends and family members over that time. I've even upgraded my Oura ring twice, always excited to explore new features. However, my most recent experience with the Gen3 upgrade has been a sobering wake-up call that compels me to share my story.What Changed:After upgrading to the Gen3 ring, I was shocked to find out that the majority of features that were previously standard are now gated behind a subscription paywall. Even more unsettling is the fact that the historical health data that my wife and I have accumulated over years is now inaccessible unless we subscribe.Why This Matters:Lack of Transparency: There was no clear or adequate warning about this monumental shift in service terms. Depending on jurisdiction, this could pose a potential violation of consumer protection laws.Data Ethics: Health data is sensitive information. To lock it away from users who have contributed to that database over years is highly questionable from an ethical standpoint.Customer Loyalty Ignored: Oura's new business model feels like a betrayal to long-standing customers. Loyal users like us find ourselves stuck with a product that has suddenly lost most of its value.What Needs to Happen:I strongly urge Oura to reconsider this strategy. I suggest two possible remedies:Restore feature and data access to customers who have been with you before the introduction of this new subscription model.Provide a complete refund for recent Gen3 purchases made under the assumption of feature continuity.In the absence of timely redress, I'll be left with no choice but to escalate this issue through all available channels, including legal avenues and additional public forums.As much as it pains me to write this review, prospective customers need to know what they're getting into. And I hope Oura takes this as a wake-up call to realign their business practices with the ethics and transparency we expect from a health and wellness company.","1","2023-10-13T05:10:24.000Z","Alex Carpenter","PH","1.0"
"I loved the 1st Gen Oura Ring, not the new one!","I loved the 1st Gen Oura Ring. After 3 years, the battery was quite deteriorated and I had to charge every night. Thus, I purchased a new one. Very disappointed to learn that the old version wasn't available anymore and that you had to get the fancy-schmancy new one with all the bells & whistles and 'membership fee.' I declined the membership immediately. I've been wearing the ring for almost 2 weeks now and there are two major issues (imho): 1- the ring glows green in the middle of the night! I get up to use the loo, get back in bed to try and go back to sleep, and then my finger starts glowing. WTH? I thought an alien had landed on my hand. It went off a few times and I thought ""I bought this ring to help me learn how to get better sleep. These LED lights going off in my totally dark room is doing just the opposite!"" 2- It isn't giving me my body temperature which is very important.Like everyone else here, I contacted Cust Serv and have received fairly quick responses. (now I know that is was AI I was hearing from- UGH!) They told me that there was no way to turn off the green LED lights. Are you kidding me? I wrote back that, had I known there was going to be flashing lights during the night, I never would have purchased. I didn't read anyone else complaining about this. Am I the only one it bothers?For the lack of temperature readings, I have to go through a million steps to try and resolve it. This includes uploading all of my ring's history to their website. Sorry, but I like to keep my own info private and have never uploaded anything to Oura other than my initial account info.I sent an email this morning saying that I cannot live with the alien lights at night and that I want to return. When they correct these flaws and come out with a new design, perhaps I will buy again. I truly loved the first Generation. We'll see if they honor my request.","1","2023-10-12T19:41:35.000Z","PATRICIA MCNULTY","US","4.0"

"Worthless without a subscription","Another potentially great company doubling-down on subscription model. The Ring I used would have been a 5/5, until I learned that they hamstring the phone app if you drop the subscription. DO NOT BUY until they change course, or they won't. We can't let every product we buy force us into continued payments. I understand R&D and ongoing tech support, but that's Oura's job to figure out. Not my job to pay for forever. But really, a  monthly subscription for a ring? Really?They don't make it obvious how terrible it is if you drop the subscription. So, after some great health data points, I have a $300+ plastic ring I can use as a paperweight. No, it's too light for that. I can't even think of something to do with it.","1","2023-10-10T18:55:57.000Z","J. Graham Hudson","US","4.0"

Customer service was friendly, and helpful, they gave an incentive coupon to purchase a new one, but when I don’t trust the long term quality, I’m not going to waste more money. Additionally, it never picked up my gym workouts, just all of my walking each day—so I had to manually add workouts each time.

They don't last a year so expect to have to buy a new charger every 7-10 months which has been our experience.

I was also pregnant for the best part of the last year and I emailed about the data as it constantly showed low readiness scores etc., that we’re not adjusting for the fact my numbers were higher (like resting heart rate) due to the pregnancy which is totally normal. When I contacted Oura about a year ago, the only option was also to buy a whole new ring, with the ongoing subscription.

They wanted me to send them a video of me troubleshooting the steps for a charger. Maybe I should have sent the results of an IQ test.","1","2023-08-02T19:22:18.000Z","Marji Holbrook","US","2.0"

It also gives me a heads up on when I'm getting sick, making me aware at least 24 hours before I would otherwise notice it myself.

I religiously did all the troubleshooting steps on their website and unfortunately nothing worked. I opened a ticket to customer support and when they finally replied (after more than 48h) it looked like they didn’t even understand my problem even though I stated clearly everything I’ve done, sent pictures, etc. After this initial reply they stopped answering again.so basically now I have an item that I purchased and I’m keeping it in a box as it’s defective and not usable.

"Many useful features, stunning quality, and excellent customer support helped to justify the cost.","Great for experimentation and seeing tangibly the results of changes to your daily routine, such as drinking less alcohol or reducing screen time, on your sleep, readiness score, etc. As a university student, I bought my ring whilst studying for very difficult exams - I was pushing myself on a daily basis, and a frequent problem I encountered was knowing when to take a break, or keep going. Checking my readiness score and quality of sleep daily helped inform me on making these decisions, ultimately helping me pass my exams without compromising my health/quality of life too much.I also found great use in the meditation recordings, another feature of the monthly subscription. Meditation/mindfulness is something I only started after buying the ring; it's now integrated itself fully into my daily routine, and I couldn't be more grateful. Whilst I wouldn't buy the ring purely for this feature, it does help justify the cost of the ring for me, along with everything else. (Though aside from the cost of the ring/monthly subscription, I did have to pay an additional 99 GBP for import duty/tax! UK buyers beware!!)Also a big fan of the notification features whereby Oura reminds you to stand up and stretch your legs when it (very accurately) detects you've been sedimentary for too long (in my case, sitting at my desk studying or in bed scrolling through Instagram); or when you're close to reaching your activity goal; or when it's approaching bedtime.I got the Rose Gold Horizon model, and it's been over a month now. The colour started off slightly yellow, but has since transitioned into a beautiful earthly rose. No chips yet, surface isbstill smooth and shiny. P.S: If you do strength training like me, make sure to take the ring off in the gym to avoid metal-to-metal contact, which is the fastest way to scratch the ring!As for the customer service, which seems to be terrible according to every other Trustpilot review, I personally encountered no issues whatsoever with Oura's support - on the contrary, they were very quick and efficient to reply to my questions/requests, taking as little as 5-10 minutes or a few hours at most. I am sorry to hear if others' experiences differed in the past, but if this is how the customer service is moving forward, then it's a sign that they've taken up the feedback in a positive way, and I'm happy to support a company that does this. Thank you to the team at Oura for your product and service!","5","2023-06-25T10:06:20.000Z","Michelle Sorocovici","GB","3.0"

The fact that you have to have a very expensive subscription to get the detailed data is poor given that it merely shows you historical data. The activity tracker is highly inaccurate.

"My sisters and I bought the Oura Ring…","My sisters and I bought the Oura Ring for our Mom for her 70th birthday. She didn't like it, and I tried using it for the 30-day trial period thereafter and reached the same conclusion.We both had the same reasons for finding the Oura Ring to be unhelpful and not worth the investment. First, the data it provides is not especially helpful, and not much more robust or actionable than what we already get with our Apple Watch. Oura's top line scores - Readiness, Sleep, and Activity - are not particularly helpful for varying reasons.First, sleep is inaccurate. I use a Dreem 2 headband, which provides sleep lap quality sleep data. The Oura Ring consistently and significantly undershot deep sleep and was also off - though less significantly - on REM sleep. The data it provided were not meaningfully different from or more accurate than Apple Watch sleep tracking data, which are generally accepted to be inaccurate. Readiness - it's a top line score that we didn't know what to do with. It didn't provide any surprising insights that were actionable. I know when I'm tired or when I'm feeling good, and don't need an expensive device to tell me to take it easy. It generally just tracked how I was feeling after a night of sleep.Activity - it doesn't provide anything more than a fitness tracker, and if you're interested in the Oura Ring, you probably already have a fitness tracker (and there are better ones out there). Finally, when I shared this with Oura and tried to return outside of the 30-day return period, they rejected my request for return. I'd expect them to stand behind a product like this, particularly when multiple members of my family tried it out.","1","2023-04-26T16:18:24.000Z","Ron","US","1.0"

"Never again, Oura","Their company is literally the worst - I used to love this product - their customer service has destroyed any shred of respect.I have purchased multiple rings (two as gifts).  Oura knew they were gifts (as we had sizing issues).  When my giftees tried to ask for customer support on the product, Oura would not help them as they were not purchased on their oura account.  Oura, why would I need four rings?  So basically three of the four purchased through my account do not have any access to customer support or upgrades.  Upgrades need to be done through my account - because the ring and purchase cannot transfer an email address.  That would have been GREAT to know BEFORE purchase but there is no mention of this anywhere and highly unusual as a standard.What's more is that now inputting my ""workouts' are not showing up in my activity score.  This impacts Activity and also Readiness and makes the platform useless for tracking and predicting these functions.  Today, my Activity told me I needed to hit it harder than normal because I had been inactive for several days - this is after manually entering in daily workouts where I work like a beast.  Today, after a 500 calorie burn (showing IN the activity panel), my burn meter is at 49.  Customer service reports that this is a known issue.  ...but it has been for months now.In summation, their customer service and policies are atrocious, and now their product has declined to an unusable hot mess.

"I've had my Oura ring since December…","I've had my Oura ring since December 2022 and it has really helped me to dial into sleep, exercise, diet, and rest patterns.

I've even seen the effect of alcohol and illness on my sleep. The daily analysis is spot on and the accuracy seems quite good.The ring is expensive and, yes, you have to pay for monthly service (both of which are obvious up front, so please let's not bang on these guys with bad reviews for what you darn well knew up front.)What isn't obvious is how useful this information and daily analysis is in improving your life. That awareness comes over time, day after day reviewing how your body is doing with rest and readiness. So well done, Oura. You should know that the finish of these rings is not particularly durable. They will scratch and no matter which one you purchase, within a month or so, you'll start to see the base silver metal gleaming from those scratches.  I'd read about this weakness and purchased the ""Stealth Black"" knowing that flat black just happens to be the color of Black Sharpies, which I use to neatly cover up scratches. So, again, read the reviews and know what you're getting: a better look at what is going on inside your body - providing you information you can use to improve yourself.It's not a perfect piece of jewelry, but it is a wonderful, insightful tool to a better life for you.","4","2023-04-20T18:58:07.000Z","Charles Welsh","US","3.0"

"Oura Ring - THINK TWICE!!!","I purchased my Oura gen 3 ring back in August 2022 along with the extended warranty.  While initially I was very pleased with the insights into my overall health, there have been some developments which have made me change my mind about this product. First of all, all the data that the ring gives you is great, however, after the trial period you must purchase a membership to continue getting that data otherwise you only get the score without the insights, which essentially tells you nothing.  It’s the details that tell you what your body is doing so that you can make changes to your habits to better your health. At the price point of this product, comparable to an Apple Watch, Oura should provide those insights without having to buy a membership.Secondly, over the last 6 months I’ve lost weight to the point that the ring no longer fits and falls off my finger rendering it unwearable.  I reached out to Oura to see about exchanging the ring for a different size and because I had purchased the ring more than 30 days prior i was told I could not exchange it for a different size.  While I understand there has to be so limits, I believe 30 days is too short of a time. Other wearables typically have 90 to 365 days to return/exchange the product if something isn’t right.In conclusion, while I enjoy the data that the ring gives me, honestly, the Oura ring just isn’t worth the price, especially considering the limited ability to exchange/return the ring. Additionally having to purchase a membership (at $75/year) to actually unlock the data is ridiculous.  You should get all the metrics without having to pay for it monthly, especially with the $400 price tag.In short you should save your money, or just purchase a smartwatch that will give you just as many metrics and be able to do many other things as well.","1","2023-04-05T20:50:46.000Z","Chuck","US","2.0"

I doubt it’s going to help us but worth a shotDear Oura Ring Company,I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with your recent decision to limit the features available on your app to just one basic function. As a loyal customer of your product, I feel that this decision is unfair and almost punitive in nature.I understand that you are trying to promote the benefits of your membership program, but I believe that this should not come at the expense of your existing customers who have supported your brand over the years. By limiting the app features, you are essentially penalizing those who have chosen not to become members.As someone who values the data and insights provided by your app, I feel that this change significantly diminishes the value of your product. It also undermines the trust that I have placed in your brand and the belief that you are committed to providing the best possible experience for your customers.I urge you to reconsider your decision and restore the full functionality of your app to all users, regardless of membership status. Doing so would not only demonstrate your commitment to customer satisfaction but also reinforce the value and quality of your brand.Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.","1","2023-04-02T15:16:20.000Z","Anthony","US","1.0"

"Holds your own data ransom","I got an Oura mainly to hopefully use it as a period tracker. I was aware that it was on beta and was hopeful it would improve as I continued to own and use it. The data for sleeping and general readiness was nice to see as well and honestly I didn't care if it was 100% accurate 24/7 or not but the temperature and heart rate was what I cared about along with period tracking/predicting. I started to rely on the ring as the features improved and I could start using it for ovulation tracking based on temperature,BUT THEN THE MEMBERSHIP RAN OUT. And guess what? That entire feature, and all of the charts and data for the other categories other than the general score numbers, were gone and locked behind a paywall. MY OWN DATA. Held ransom. With the membership there was like four sections of screen to swipe between. And with that gone, now only two. But guess what stayed? The stupid meditation videos and sleep music, which is now one of the two screens. You know. The stuff that should have been the membership. Trying to navigate fertility in the blind now is a major life upset as I had just begun to get the confidence to use the temperature and cervical mucus methods which are in line with my religion, but no! Money and greed is the name of Oura's game. Again. I already paid all that money for this product, which should have all the data and charts as BASE info. The video and music stuff? THAT should have been the membership. They could have made the membership be a competition between friends to have the best scores or something else ""extra"". Put the ""based on your sleep last night you should rest today!"" ""What chronotype are you?"" stuff behind the paywall. Imagine if one of those exercise watches that counts your steps and calories and heart rate etc cut off everything but step count. NO, worse than that. Imagine if it took all that data, did some behind the scenes math and gave you a vague number score for how you did today. ""So how many steps did I do, how's my calorie burn?"" You ask. ""Oh we know, but here's an arbitrary number, subscribe for the actual data you produced yourself and we now hold hostage! Thanks for that, sucker!""Honestly screw Oura and I will never suggest it to anyone else. If I could have my way I'd want the same thing the old Gen people get, the lifetime membership, because DUH. That's what the BASIC plan should be. The ring is useful and non invasive in my life, the whole point of buying it. I don't want to return it or get rid of it because I know just how much I liked it. But now it is a useless piece of tech waste. There is no way I'm paying a subscription to see my own data. Where is the morals? This is health data we are talking about. There are stories about people finding out they had heart problems or caught that they had covid early with this thing but they had to have had the membership because there is no charts to show you that data otherwise. It's just plain predatory what Oura is doing.","1","2023-03-24T04:25:02.000Z","No","US","1.0"
"Buyer Beware","Save your Money!#1 The battery life is atrocious. The first 6 months the battery charge lasted about 6-7 days.  After 6 months, it doesn't even last a day before alerting you that it needs to charge. I can literally charge first thing in the morning and by the evening it will tell me to charge before going to bed. #2 Worthless without the membership.  I find it absurd to pay nearly $350 for a product that then requires a $6.39/monthly expense just to see the information it is ""supposedly"" gathering. #3 This leads me to my third point.  The data it does gather is extremely inaccurate, which is why it led me to discontinue paying for a membership.  It would tell me that I had slept so many hours when in fact I was up and about cleaning the house yet it was recording me as sleeping.  It would also not accurately account for REM sleep, when in fact I know I was in REM sleep because I woke up recalling my dreams in vivid detail yet the ring would say I was awake.  It rarely accurately analyzed my actual time in bed sleeping patterns. Also would not accurately account for workout time periods.Save your money!  Oura hasn't figured out the technology piece yet.

The sleep and heart rate functions are no better and seem worse than my Apple Watch. I thought because the ring is on a finger it would be better5. When inputting exercise options it doesn’t have Barrecore. In summary, it’s uncomfortable constantly during the day and cramps the fingers at night as they swell and the ring is so thick. The software isn’t that great. I spent about £700 after Uk duties and  kicking myself for not get in g another Apple Watch.

"I will not be purchasing another Oura ring.","I purchased a new Oura Ring at the end of 2021 and started using it in early 2022. I loved my ring and the information it gave me on my sleep, movement, and readiness. I loved the sleekness of the ring and how wearable it was without feeling bulky or uncomfortable. Sadly, in less than a year of use, the ring's battery life started to dwindle. At about a year of use, it wouldn't last more than 24 hours on a charge which isn't useful for hiking trips. The Oura ring is expensive as a fitness tracker and charges a monthly subscription to gain access to all of the info it is gathering. The readiness score often did not translate to how I felt physically and hitting my snooze button upon waking would affect my number more than it should, in my opinion. I wouldn't mind the cost or even the monthly charge if it didn't crap out so quickly. I will not be purchasing another Oura ring.","2","2023-02-18T18:02:01.000Z","Tricia Bowen Balonier","US","1.0"

"Stay away from this ring if you don’t want to keep paying","I have had a OURA ring for almost a year now. When I bought the ring it was no way near clear, that the ring after six month would be almost useless unless you started paying around 7 dollars a month for their premium membership. I was not willing to pay this, as I already had payed 400 dollars for the ring. So after the free 6 month membership ended, I was only able to read 3, THREE, numbers from the device, and only able to read them at certain time a day. I’m usually first in bed after 12 and if I want to read the numbers before going to bed I’m not able to as they will not display data from the day before when you’re not a member. I have written to them tons of times. And each time they say they look into to it. But the same time argue why it’s fair that I pay for the membership. Now several month have gone and the ring is basically useless to me, so I have sold it of for 100 dollars. The encounter with this cheating company I could have been with out.","1","2023-02-13T09:14:10.000Z","Jens Leth-Nissen","DK","14.0"

I received a response telling me to back up my data, and after that my ring worked better for awhile, but now the charge is again just lasting for a day.

Today all my data went blank and I found out that all you get is your ""score"" for rediness, sleep and activity w/none of the backup.  It has now turned into a useless piece of junk jewelry.  If I had known that the Gen3 came with strings attached, I would have sent it back as soon as received.  How can this not be deceptive sales practice?  I was such a fan of the ring and was very complimentary to anyone that asked.  I feel sad for my kids as they spent their money to give this to me and I am not going to allow for a business to continue to get my data without me allowing access to that data.

"So far a 4-star","So far a 4-star. I did have a glitch in the ordering after I got my sizing kit, which I did get very quickly. But there was a problem on the ordering screen and I could not confirm my ring size. After a bit of frustration I did contact Support which I (think) was via email but I’m not sure.  it was late in the evening and I got an immediate reply saying yes they were having problems with their ordering system but she took my ring size and manually entered it in their system. The order went through quickly and I had my ring within a week. I have only had the ring three days but I will post my initial experience and update later as needed. I got the GEN 3 base model (no special color) silver ring. I recorded one work out but afterwards the app told me it didn’t record any heart rate monitoring during the work out. I was on a Nordic track skier machine, so yes I was gripping a plastic handle in my hand. - very disappointing since my Nordic track is my go to bad weather work out. And not getting a heart rate for an entire work out kind of defeats the purpose. I also get some gaps during the day where I have no heart rate measured so I am suspecting if I sized too big? But when I had the sizing kit I really questioned the next size smaller, thinking it was cutting off circulation or when my finger swells during long hikes I was afraid it would be too small.Anyway the sleep data for now seems OK. I do have a lot of questions as to how it knows when I’m in bed versus just chilling in the evening watching TV on the couch, but it has been accurate for the first two nights so far. I am disappointed to see all of the one and two star reviews here, I did not read them before my purchase.

"Just not what I expected","This ring gives a lot of data, LIKE A LOT A LOT but if your score is low in a particular category, there’s no advice on how to better it. In my opinion, if you’re pulling an extreme amount of data, you should be able to tell me how to tweak certain aspects to achieve favorable scores. I believe this is something that may come in time, but they’re definitely lacking currently. Also, if you order the wrong size, DO NOT process it as an exchange. Go ahead and full on return the product as a refund and out right buy another. Their policy is one exchange OR refund. So if you exchange your ring for a size issue, you WILL NOT be able to return the ring if you find out later you do not like it.","2","2023-01-12T00:25:54.000Z","Chan","US","1.0"

"Oura is a 5-star product","Oura is a 5-star product. I am not a person who writes reviews, but I'm reviewing this now in case it helps even one person balance the negative reviews on trust pilot. It seems that people only come to trust pilot when they have a complaint, so you only see the negative. This week I was planning to buy an ebike. I checked out the ebike reviews on trust pilot, and it almost made me give up. Then to calibrate, I checked out the reviews for eightsleep and for oura. Two products I really love. Both are two stars? LoL! No way!I don't like buying an unproven gadget from a small company. Did it work? Is it reliable? Will the company even be around to honor the warranty? Unfortunately, it is not on amazon, so it's hard to get reliable reviews. I'm glad I took the plunge with oura. I've had it for two years, and I'm on my second ring, I gave my first one to my dad and he also loves it. Their web site and software and customer service are all great. The ring maybe had some quirks in the beginning, but it has been so long I don't even remember, and now it is part of my everyday habit so it is hard give a fresh perspective.A few things...I wish it could track HRV all the time, but I guess you can only really get that from a chest strap monitor. It is great for sleep, though! I wish it had more guided meditation features.  I'm very surprised at how sturdy it is. I don't recommend treating it like I do (once you wear it all the time it is hard to remember that you have a pretty complex gadget on your finger), but so far it has held up to everything.Best of luck with the product.

Still a disappointing decline, but it seems that perhaps some issue on Oura side may have at least been adjusted. No transparency or alerts shared by Oura - but felt worth mentioning that ring quasi-usable. Original post 10/20/2022: After firmware update to oura ring...battery life went from a couple days to not holding a charge. Out of warranty period shouldn't mean open-season on older models - functionally ""killing"" the product with updates that render the unit useless. My frustration stems from Oura's handling of situation - which feels like it has all the ingredients of a class action lawsuit. Oura recognized and acknowledged their battery issues with product...yet did not notify users that updates may render their ring useless. Why not just invite customers to throw their ring away instead of wasting time & effort of rediscovering this known condition - then try to solve - with no Oura remedy - nor an opportunity to restore former settings that make product usable? Instead - they offer you a ""gracious"" opportunity to hand them another $400 - minus a $75 customer discount. This product defect - and their handling of the issue - do not feel like a relationship worth continuing - if their business model includes rendering models over 2 years old functionally obsolete - with incompatible updates.

I was mistaken and then would like to return the ring. Created a ticket (as their faq says) and a supporter answered - they would like a screenshot of a missing feature (not sure how to do that). I answered i would just like to return, But again they are asking for a screenshot of what is not there. Have sent a screenshot of their return policy, and hope the supporter gets what i am asking, but am not that hopefull.","1","2022-11-21T15:04:56.000Z","Anders Ørsted Pedersen","DK","12.0"

"Terrible battery life and customer service","The ring is cool... when it works.  A bit overpriced but I must say that I do appreciate what it offers. The company, however, is a bit dysfunctional.I bought the gen 2 ring and not even six months later they announced the gen 3 where you would need to pay a monthly subscription fee to get the data.  I was offered $50 to buy the gen 3 with a lifetime membership included.  I was pissed that I now had to upgrade in order to access all the features but I did.  I have had the gen 3 less than a year and the battery lasts maybe a day and a half.  Their customer service is awful.  They will sometimes take more than a month to respond.My battery was having issues approaching the year of buying the Gen 3.  I had some rep run diagnostics and tell me there was no issue with my ring's battery which was simply not true. My battery wasn't even lasting 2 days.  I opened another ticket two weeks later when battery life dropped to a day.  They responded and said they would replace the ring as they can see it was defective.  But a week ago it wasn't? They are a mess.  I did get a replacement ring, though, so I did alter my original review.  More like a 2.5 than a 3.","3","2023-09-19T16:05:27.000Z","StrangeAsAngels","US","28.0"
"Life Membership Not Allowed","Hello everyone, this is just my last reply, as these guys are ripping everyone off. It's crazy! If you know where I can complain, that would be wonderful. Hi Mark(Oura ring customer service),Thank you for your reply and detailed information, but you are avoiding my questions directly.Let me be more clear, as you are trying to be just politically correct, but not helpful.I have 2 rings, membership for life, size 2 and size 10 and I wish to use them both.I have paid for both and I am entitled to use them both 100% day by day, as you received my money 100% for both.I don't need your 1 month complimentary, as I am entitled all my life to use daily both these rings paid.How can I achieve this in the same time, as I paid and you guaranteed 100% for what I paid: membership for life for both.You sold them to me, you accepted the money, I need to get the promised service. I have 2 rings and I want you to tell me how to use them both in the same time.If you are not able to do that, that means WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM. Misleading and Misinformation after I paid the money promised that I would use them both, it's your problem, not mine.When you saw a second ring bought by me, actually I bought 5 until now, you supposed to flag me and decline my purchase on the same email address, letting me know: YOU CAN'T USE 2 RINGS ON THE SAME TIME WITH THE SAME EMAIL ADDRESS.This way, I could easily use my second email address, cristienake@gmailcom to purchase this size 6 ring and I was not supposed to lose so much time with this such a low quality customer service for someone who bought 5 rings.Are you guys crazy? THIS IS A SIMPLE THING TO FIX, AS THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM, NOT MINE.I WANT YOU OR A MANAGER TO FIX IT, I PAID, YOU NEED TO FIND THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM CREATED BY YOU.DON'T TAKE MY MONEY AND TELL ME AFTER, YOU SEE, ACTUALLY YOUR MEMBERSHIP FOR LIFE INCLUDED IN THE DEAL, YOU CAN'T USE IT.ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? IF YOU ARE NOT A CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER OR YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO SOLVE THIS VERY SIMPLE ISSUE, I WANT YOU TO ESCALATE THIS ISSUE HIGHER.ALSO, PLEASE LET US KNOW, WHERE WE CAN COMPLAIN, LEGALLY SPEAKING AGAINST YOU.

However, my opinion of the product and company has rapidly gone downhill - the customer service is also horrendous. After purchasing the Generation 3 ring and knowing that you would have to pay for a membership, which I didn't want to do (after the so-called 'free' membership expired) Oura's marketing led me (and vast amounts of others) that you would only 'lose' the new statistical analysis which came into play with the Generation 3 ring. What a shameful marketing ploy - not only did you lose the new analysis but everything that existed previously. You only have three screens which are completely useless without the background information. Tom Hale, the CEO of Oura needs to be totally ashamed of what Oura has done and how he has let his customers down. I am taking this further on a legal basis and with the Trading Standards governmental departments both in Finland and California. The customers who were not told the truth either need a full reinstatement of the analysis or a full refund.","1","2022-11-04T16:49:09.000Z","Iain","GB","18.0"

"I could not live without my Oura ring","Finally, I did receive my Oura ring and it is an amazing device. Of all the devices I have owned -and still do- over the past 20 years, it is by far the best.I have used it for more than a year now and it is part of my everyday, more than my smartwatch. It has helped me improved my health in general, not only with keeping me active but also sleeping better,and having better habits.One of the reason it surpasses my other devices is that the Oura ring battery lasts several days and if I put it on its charger for 5 or 10 minutes here and there, I actually never have to worry about it dying.  Because of that, I have been able to keep a perfect track of my sleep and my activities in a surprisingly constant manner, no glitch..Sleep: It analyzes my sleep perfectly, keeping track not only of its length but also of its pattern and quality, as well as measuring my heart rate, my body temperature, my oxygen level (and based on these data, I was able to suspect that I had Covid-19, took a test which confirmed it).The readiness and activity components are also excellent, helping me in every aspect of my life.Finally, the app is updated regularly, making it better and better as time passes.","5","2022-10-25T18:31:07.000Z","Rosine Sauvage","US","4.0"

"The ring is inaccurate and no support","The ring is inaccurate. I have tried the ring since the beginning of the year and it is completely inaccurate. I have compared results with medical grade test devices to come to this conclusion. I have attempted to get answers from Oura support and they never answer my questions. They just ignore the the questions. Most recently after asking why the steps were different than my other steps tracking devices and they said it’s because Oura is more sensitive. So I said “Then why Oura always record less steps even though I wear it 24 hours a day?” They had no answer. The sleep tracking works intermittently and when it does actually record my sleep, it’s wrong. I had a medical sleep test for apnea and compared the results to Oura. Completely different. I asked my cardiologist about the Oura results because I wanted to know the significance of some of the measurements and he said “Some of the items Oura tracks are pretty meaningless from the standpoint of understanding what’s going on with your heart”. Oura support has still not answered my questions. I also lost a ring. Someone found it and returned it to OURA. OURA said they shipped it back to me and I should check the tracking number. Sadly they didn’t provide one and all my attempts to get them to answer me since I requested the tracking number have been ignored.This is evidently a foreign company. They take up to four weeks to respond and then you get no help. You can’t speak to a person and get real answers. They don’t have any. I would like to know where they are located so I can have my attorney serve them for non performance. I started asking for my money back a few months ago but got no answer.

I don't recall any information through the app on this and now they brand themselves as the membership being their product which isn't fair to early adopters. If it wasn't because the ring was so expensive it would have been fine, but even then the value the ring provides me doesn't nearly come close to other membership apps (Eg. Calm). It was a good product while being free but I do NOT recommend buying this now unless you're a pro-athlete, scholar, or financially well off enough. The accuracy of the ring and the information isn't adequate enough for them to charge a membership fee in my opinion but to each their own.","1","2022-10-07T15:35:31.000Z","Christoffer","DK","4.0"

They asked me all these questions and I answered them all and after about 12 emails back-and-forth they said they couldn't find me in the system and I said that's not my problem the problem is with this ring. I had to give them my daughters information they said that's fine as long as they had her name and that didn't turn up anything. And I said it's absolutely irrelevant it was given to me as a gift the ring is not charging what do you want to do about it?They told me to give them all this information and at the end of the 12 emails back-and-forth they dumped me. They didn't want to discuss it they did not want any more information and you can tell by the documentation because they said they it was not charging from their end. willing to replace it. After this review I will take it to the Better Business Bureau. The issue is the fact that the ring is not charging properly is probably a manufacturing issue which is fine it happens to the best of us unfortunately it happened to me and I wanted them to replace the ring it's that simple it didn't have to be brand new it could've been one of the older models I didn't really care but I wished it would charge properly now it's just a circular device that matches my watchband it's absolutely useless and I feel terrible for my daughter because it doesn't work.I would recommend in all honesty to stay away from this particular ring. Because their customer service is absolutely terrible.

I am so disappointed that your company's not interested in keeping those existing customers happy and allowing them the continued use of a great tool,  but instead more focused on software and squeezing out some extra dollars for those same customers for what should be free when we pay $400-500 for the thing.

"Extremely poor experience","Extremely poor experience. First - with the purchase - I preorder a new Gen3 ring a year ago and then got it in the wrong size. Tried to solve the issue for 3(!!!) months as they do not provide customer support. And then in 9 months when my subscription was over and I didn't want to pay any extra for their service (as the ring is quite expensive, the same price as Apple Watch, for example), they left me with literally NO data. Nor from the past, not for today. So I don't have the promised ""basic features"", they leave you with nothing once you're not ready to pay for the membership. It is insane when you purchase an expensive ring that is not working without an app, for which you have to pay extra. I've never seen something like this. Oura ring was a brilliant idea ruined by their poor marketing and absolutely useless support service. Such a shame! Will never repeat the purchase again and don't recommend it.","1","2022-09-26T15:12:50.000Z","Valerie Grinevich","RU","1.0"
"You've really shot yourself in the foot with the Gen 3 ring Oura!","I received the Gen 3 ring for Christmas from my wife, I bought her a Gen 2 ring earlier in 2021.I really enjoyed using the ring and was impressed by the data it delivered.The first problem was a serious change in the battery performance following the SpO2 upgrade, in August, but this was a minor problem and simply required more charging.The main issue is the way the data has now all but completely disappeared following my decision not to pay for membership.My wife's Gen 2 ring is still free and still providing a wealth of useful data, this just seems like an excuse to get as much cash out of loyal customers as possible.How about a new features which customers pay for on a one-off basis, if they want them?Unfortunately I've taken my ring off now and won't be using it any more, I was also a very proud ambassador for Oura rings, but I certainly won't be telling anyone to buy one now, you've really shot yourself in the foot with the Gen 3 ring Oura!","1","2022-09-26T13:55:09.000Z","Nick Hodson","GB","2.0"
"What is more useless: Oura ring or its customer service?","This ring tells me that I'm sleeping when I'm simply laying on sofa. It also tells me that feel excellent when I feel under the weather and that I'm unhealthy when I feel good. Some other measurements don't always seem to make sense. I'm questioning set of parameters they use to assess our physical condition, as well as precision of their measurements. The ring got covered with scratches withing a few days of wearing and started looking no so attractive.When I realized that this ring has nothing to do with reflecting my actual physical condition and that it's so grossly mistaken about my sleep measurement, I decided to get rid of this ring and go to my account to remove my payment method from there so the don't charge me for their membership in the future and don't keep my financial information to avoid hacks and payment data theft.Turned out, they don't even have an electronic account profile where you can do this. After some efforts, I've found how to send a message to customer service. Agent simply replied that since I've cancelled my membership, they won't charge my payment method. I replied them that I'm still asking to remove my payment info from their system. They simply ignored my messages.I think this ring is too inaccurate to be useful. But I'm hesitating to tell what is more useless: Oura ring itself or its customer service.Update: Oura's customer service finally replied to me and confirmed that they removed my payment data from their system. I don't have a way to check this because they don't have a user portal where you can see/change your payment details. But I'll take their word for this and add 1 star to my review.","3","2022-09-27T17:04:40.000Z","El","US","7.0"

First 4 emails from the website went unanswered despite saying 24 hour response time.  Opened a new ticket in the app and got a response in 48 hours and immediate replacement which has worked so far but not an inspiring start.  Also, think the warranty may be shortened to one year on Gen 3 and doesn’t not restart with a replacement due to defect so may happen again without ability to replace.

The ring worked perfectly for the first 4 months or so but as soon as the new blood oxygen reading software update was launched suddenly I started having a ton of problems with it. It couldn't keep a charge, the sleep monitoring accuracy cratered and the charger itself burned hot when it was plugged in. It also blinked white repeatedly regardless of whether the ring was on it or not. I've been chatting back and forth with their after service for almost 2 months now and they are completely useless. After each response I need to raise a new ticket and when I do get responses, they are mostly offering basic troubleshooting advice. They've eventually admitted it is due to the update and their ""engineers are working on the problem"" so in the meantime, I'm stuck holding onto a 500 dollar piece of plastic that I can't return.

However recently battery life has gone down to a few hours and if it goes low during the night or early morning, the ring doesn’t register any data for the entire night. Sometimes what it considers “too low” to be able to record data is just anything below 70%. This means the ring is now useless.

Then, if you try to work it out with customer service they make you jump through a million hoops, try a million things to get it to work properly and some things work temporarily but never fix the problem totally. There is no customer service phone number and you end up in an endless back and forth by email but they will never take responsibility and replace the damn thing or refund you. Stay away from this product. Not worth it!   UPDATE:OURA DID FINALLY agree to replace the ring and give me a new, updated version.

"If I could do zero stars I would 🤬","If I could do zero stars I would. This company has the WORST customer service. There is no customer service phone number, it’s solely handled through email. My first ring would not connect to the Bluetooth on my phone. They sent me a second ring and the same thing happened. They asked me to ship it back for inspection. When the ring arrived back in Finland from Atlanta, I asked to simply refund it, as this had been a month long process because they are slow to respond. They agreed and asked for my patience and NEVER responded to me again. It has been almost 3 weeks and I have not heard from them and every time I send an email in their app asking for some compassion and communication, they close the conversation without replying. They are literally robbing me over $500 and I have tried to dispute this with Affirm (I chose to pay through installments). Because I reached out to them 5 days after their 60 policy, they’re refusing to investigate and reach out to the merchant (Oura). I feel totally violated and taken advantage of. Horrendous people to do business with. I cannot stress enough just how awful and stressful this ordeal has become and they show not a drop of humanity.

"Worthless activity tracker in Oura ring, gen 3","i have bought an Oura ring, gen 3, and I am super disappointed with the activity tracker.Apparently, the activity tracker measures all hand movements, which means that you add on activity when watching TV, working on your computer, having lunch with a friend - basically while you are doing nothing. And on top of that, you receive congratulating messages on approaching/reaching your activity goal, when you are super inactive and sitting still.I have had contact with Oura customer service because I though that my ring was broken. But here they explained to me that everything was working as it should. That means that the activity tracker is in fact worthless to use, and you need another device for this.I think Oura should inform customers about this on their website.

"Not worth it: Terrible customer service and questionable material quality.","Genuinely the worst customer service and then add on the poor quality of the ring materials. Ring quality: I've had my ring just about 6 months. I chose to get the gold one. I started noticing quickly that the ring scratches easily. Then by month 4-5 I started noticing the color didn't look that gold anymore. The ring color has rubbed off substantially all over the edges to silver. I take my ring off to wash my hands or shower and don't wear it to lift weights because it'll scratch. It's still covered in scratches and the color is worn off. For a $400+taxes ring, this is ridiculous. Customer service: Literally took forever to respond. They then closed my case altogether and I had to reopen it through different channels to finally get a response. Now, they've asked me to return my ring so that they can examine it and then send me a replacement. Hmmm, no. That's a terrible policy. Most companies would see the defective coating on it and say okay, send a replacement, and then ask me to send my original one back in the packaging. Considering how slow the service is at Oura, I'm only guessing that I would end up without my ring for who knows how long. I'd rather just get a refund and go buy another vendor at that point. I asked them to send me a replacement and then I'll return this one. Their response was no that isn't their policy... I have been going back and forth with this company for over 2 weeks because it takes them ages to respond and then their responses are not useful or solution oriented. Therefore, would I recommend the ring? Not anymore. I liked it but the quality and long-term use seems extremely questionable and the customer service is terrible.","1","2022-06-11T01:27:08.000Z","Chava","US","3.0"

"Only 14 months of lifetime - bad deal...","My Oura ring 2 only worked properly for about 14 months. When I bought my ring, I actually had it sitting on my desk for a year before I started using it. When I finally got around to registering and using it, I was quite happy with it.  However......after a year or so, I noticed that the battery life was changing. It would have around 40% battery left going to bed, only to find the ring ""dead"" the next morning (leaving me without tracking). It was annoying but did not make much of it. I started charging the ring more often, now every 2 days. Then a friend told me that the ring may have a known battery issue and I should contact support. I did. And yes, they did in fact confirm that my ring had the known battery issue. However, since my battery issues started 2 months after the guarantee period finished, I was out of luck. They offered me a $75 discount on a new ring (which comes with a monthly subscription, nonetheless). Now, what frustrates me, is that I only used the ring for 14 months until my issues started. Had I used the ring from the day it arrived at my house, I guess I could be more understanding. But in my case, the ring only functioned properly for 14 months. At $315, I am expecting a longer lifetime. The thing is, you need to register the ring and get an account to use the ring. Therefore it is very easy for Oura to see that the ring starts failing after only 14 months, despite I physically had it for 2+ years. That's the thing with data. They are trackable...I cannot recommend a $315 product that has a lifetime of barely a year. Get yourself an Apple Watch or Fitbit or anything else.

"Seemed a promising concept but has…","Seemed a promising concept but has tended to perform fairly poorly. A fairly small set of sizes means it can be tricky to get a good fit. Potentially useful HRV measured overnight but seemingly uses RMSSD as opposed to SDNN which seems more common. Sleep tracking is hit and miss - mostly seems to be reasonably accurate but occasionally has an off day (or night). A few times it doesn't seem to pick up the end of sleeping, even though I have been logging activities. Easy to log workouts after the event but the automatic workout tracking is pretty poor and doesn't seem to detect much other than walking (apart from when it decided I was strength training at 4am whilst actually sleeping). Worst part is of late the iOS app constantly completely crashes on opening meaning I often have to remove the app, reinstall and then reconnect the app. For UK customers be aware that tax isn't included in the purchase price so you'll be charged VAT by the courier on top of what you've already paid. Interesting idea but needs lots of work, and definitely not worth continuing with the paid subscription.","2","2022-04-28T18:19:35.364Z","Martin Sims","GB","4.0"

"How a company lost their ethics and morals while growing - The Oura Story","Oura ring passionate user since 2018 (Generation 2). Then, Generation 3 was announced and with it Oura decided to strip functionalities and capabilities that had always been available with the purchase of a Generation 2 Oura ring, unless I bought a new Generation 3 ring and with it I would get ""lifetime access"" to the new premium purchase. So basically, they extorted old users for their money in order to be able to continue using what they were promised when they purchased their previous ring. Appalling, to say the least.Begrudingly, I purchased Generation 3 to do exactly what I did with Generation 2. New features not only not interest me but the vast majority of them is NOT available yet. One day, Oura promise, they will be. We don't know when, but they must keep their promises, right?From a passionate user of almost three years until Gen 3 came about, I would now never buy a new Oura ring, nor would I recommend them to anybody.Oura is a company that lost their ethics and morals while growing up.

"not accurate. not worth it.","I’ve had a Gen2 for over a year now. Initially I loved it and thought its information seemed to be mostly accurate but that is absolutely not the case as of late. For the last few months, 6/7 nights it consistently says I’m awake off and on between the hours of 10pm and 12am, sometimes indicating I was awake for up to an hour at a time. This is completely untrue. I go to bed between 8 and 9 most nights and those first few hours are when I know I sleep the hardest. My bf comes to bed later, and he’s not quiet getting ready for bed but I hear nothing and stir none in my sleep. I’m out. And then there are many times where the ring doesn’t register when I actually do wake up. My cat likes to start waking me anytime between 3 and 5am and I’m constantly waking up to hush him or kick him out of the room. Yet during this period, my ring thinks I’ve been sound asleep. My body temp also always runs hot at night, always has, so my ring always thinks I’m either sick or unrecovered from yesterdays activities. It’s all pretty frustrating because it always messes with my readiness score and I’m always told to take it easy, even though I feel well rested and energetic enough to take on my usual activities. For these reasons, I don’t feel like it’s worth the hype or the cost. Just too many inaccuracies.","2","2022-04-17T18:07:45.000Z","B Carter","US","1.0"

Oura lists on their website there are delivery charges but it fails to say that it’s >£50. The ring arrived and it was too small. I emailed Oura to arrange an exchange. This was painful, they take over a day to reply to each email so it was incredibly slow. Once they finally organised for DHL to collect the ring, DHL were a no show.

"Very similar experience to other reviewers.","Very similar experience to many other reviewers here - my Gen 2 ring broke and I was told that they’d be offering me a free Gen 3 upgrade replacement. Shipped my Gen 2 ring back months ago and still haven’t received my new ring. Customer service is a joke - they continue leading me around in circles and not acknowledging my issue. Or worse, saying they’ll get back to me but then never do. I still believe in the product, but the customer service is pitiful.","1","2022-03-26T20:59:56.000Z","Kevin Y","US","1.0"
"I am so surprised at all the negative…","I am so surprised at all the negative reviews. I have used Oura since 2019/Gen 2 and upgraded to Gen 3 at the launch. The discount offered offset the UK customs charge (cheers Brexit), contrary to other reviews we were not asked to send our rings back and I kept my Gen 2 as a back up in case I lose or break my Gen 3. As an upgrading user I was offered free app usage for life, which I am really happy about. Shipping for both Gen 2 and Gen 3 was fast, I got the sizing kit in less than a week then the same with the ring, less than a week from size confirmation to receiving it. And while my Gen 3 holds charge a shorter time than my Gen 2, I assume thats because it does more stuff. I still only charge every 3 days, compared to an Apple Watch which needs to sit on its charger ALL night EVERY night.Oura has changed my behaviour for the better, I rest more, I take sleep more seriously and I get early signs if I am getting sick allowing me to focus on eating better and maybe cancelling some work outs.SO surprised at the reviews on here, I have a number of friends who have an Oura and none of us have had any of these issues.","5","2022-03-24T16:39:42.000Z","Ruth","GB","6.0"

"Love the ring but No response for 4 months?! They have my money & my ring. APPAULING","One star because I was happy with my gen 2 ring - I don't wear jewellery because it drives me nuts but it was lightweight and comfortable. However, I only had it for a month before I was asked to send it back on the 18th November 2021. It's March 23 2022. I have no ring (which I bought to track circadian rhythms - a vital component of my bipolar management strategy). I’m an extremely understanding person having worked in sales and customer service for decades, but I haven't had a response to a single email since November 19th when I responded to the 'swap your gen 2 ring for a gen 3' email. They have my ring and my $450AUD (alot for me) and they can't even respond to an email ... I've sent 10-15. An email was sent from oura on the 7th Feb suggesting they'd been inundated by interest and were training new support staff but still not a single email has been responded to. EPIC FAIL OURA RING. I have NEVER experienced such low integrity and poor quality customer service. I can't even think about the money or the ring or the wasted time and energy it makes me want to be sick. Just such poor poor business practice.ADDITION AFTER LEAVING COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA >>I was happy to receive a PM from the OURA social media team after I left the above paragraph as a comment on a few posts. They managed to get a support person to email me, I felt a glimmer of hope. The staff member shared the step I’d missed in the process of getting my replacement ring sent to me (inputting my ring size). This was super helpful and I was grateful … even though it took 6 months to get the information. However, I’d sent 4 emails in 2022 to notify OURA that I was moving interstate so I could give a new postage address and stop paying the $30 a month mail redirection fee (which I set up just for the ring when I heard nothing from OURA between November and when I moved in Feb 10). When I went online and put my ring size in, the site confirmed my selection but there was nothing about confirming shipping address. I immediately looked in all the ‘my profile’ options and saw nowhere to change my address. I sent an email to the staff member who helped me to see if the address could be changed before postage. I then searched the FAQs on how to change my address. I logged in via the mobile app and the web address, nowhere could I change a postage address. Which I can understand given that normally it’s a one off product purchase and if they’re way busier than expected but OURA asked everyone with gen 2 rings to send them back in exchange for a gen 3. To me it makes sense to confirm people’s postage address in case it had changed since they bought their original ring. Before I heard back from anyone, 12 hours after I selected my ring size, I received an automated email telling me that my ring had been shipped - to the address I no longer live at. Sigh. I immediately responded to this email aswell. When I heard back from the original staff member I’d been emailing with, the response I got was incomplete and left me wondering AGAIN if my email had been read properly. “My apologies for missing your address change request. Due to sales tax reasons, shipping addresses can As previously shared, your order has already shipped out.

Clearly the staff member hadn’t read my emails. The response I received to my reply to the automated ‘your ring has been shipped email’ was equally disappointing.

Frankly asking people people to check the T&Cs / small is disgraceful. It's totally disingenuous to have no mention anywhere on your website or emails.

I purchased the new Gen 3 gold model for my girlfriend in Nov 2021 as an Xmas gift. We were sent the sizing kit a couple of weeks later, hoping the ring would come before Xmas but also understanding that it might not, and that was OK. About 3 weeks in Jan 2022 we had still heard nothing from Oura and enquired about our order. We were given a response saying that they were having to cancel the order because the shipping address was entered incorrectly, trying to put the blame on us and get out of honouring the small discount they offered at the time of purchase. We were left confused as they had already sent the sizing kit to our correct address. We pleaded with them to re-check it and to process the original order. Back and forth this continued, each time with another generic response, saying sorry we can't help, or we will escalate this further. It is now March and we have finally given up.

The ring has yet to record a workout done on my home trainer (bike). My second heart rate monitor used during workout for comparison (pulse belt from Polar) records between 70 - 160 hbpm --> Oura stays between my resting pulse high 30'ties to 55.The ring seems (? can i trust that when workouts are not recognized) to capture non-active periods of the day, but rest is off.I've tried to reach out to customer service several times - only response I've gotten was basically ""you've had the product for more than 30 days and as of there's nothing we (Oura) can do"".I've tried to send 3 emails over the course of the last 30 days, each email is responded to with a generic ""we're busy and will get back in 7 days"". Nothing heard.Right now, no chance I would consider continuing the subscription service after the first 6 months free. I would actually expect a refund as the workout feature does not seem to work.Hope it helps to reach out for help here - again, the key target is to get the product to work, I truly hope my first unit was just an odd one out.","1","2022-03-15T00:46:29.000Z","Rasmus Barfred","DK","3.0"

"OURA rings are a NIGHTMARE!","I received my Oura ring August 2020. I was impressed with my sleeping info but my day info was not accurate so I only wore it at night. I wore it for about three months then misplaced my ring in my bedroom. Once I  found and charged my ring, I couldn't get the ring to work. I bought a new phone thinking my phone wouldn't take the constant updates that Oura sent and I got the ring to work, never 100% though.I then began wearing it only while sleeping again and had an interesting experience, several actually. I guess Oura didn't appreciate my many texts complaining about my ring not working and requesting my money back. Before I  bought the ring I was told there was a one year guarantee. After the ring not working and asking for my money back through emails every week for months, I  started having night TERRORS when wearing my ring! I mean really bad, bad nightmares. My lifestyle or food that I ate had not changed, don't do drugs or alcohol. Then it came to me......Oura was connected to ME through my ring .....why did I think my ring was only being used by an app? As soon as I stopped wearing my Oura ring, my nightmares  stopped completely.  I truly believe that Oura was transmitting 'something' through the ring that affected me!!! I know that Apple watches are used to send vibrations to wake up people who have PTSD that are beginning to have a nightmare b/c I was screened for the study that has been currently approved by the FDA for Veterans. If that company could monitor and send info to the wearer then Oura certainly has the same technology. I still have not gotten a response from the FINLAND based company about an address to send my ring back. And, there is no phone number to which you can call and talk to an actual person, very clever.I would never recommend Oura to anyone; there is ZERO customer service once they get your money. And my nightmare experience, well, I will never ever trust another piece of technology jewelry on my body.","1","2022-03-08T22:33:00.000Z","Jo W.","US","7.0"
"Really poor customer service and inaccurate product","Shocking customer service. After 2 months of trying and relentlessly following up I finally managed to arrange for a return of the product; initially I wanted to exchange the ring for a smaller size, but after my experience with customer service I decided to return the product altogether as had no confidence in them. effectively dealing with any future queries. Having sent the ring back it took another 4 weeks (and me following up a few times) for the money to arrive back with me.I truly understand and appreciate that high-growth businesses sometimes face ’growing pains’ and can't keep up with demand, but this does not appear to be a new 'issue' Oura are dealing with... Perhaps it's time to re-invest some of the revenue into a proper customer service team that can handle the volume of enquiries coming through.I also didn't think the ring was all that amazing either, having trialed it for three weeks. Apparently I slept like a baby every night during that time, which I certainly did not feel that way and it astonished me as to how that can be. I was very excited about this product but am leaning towards it being just a wellbeing gimmick.","1","2022-06-19T16:37:53.000Z","nalalee","GB","9.0"

"Worst experience","Oura ring needs investigating! I have never experienced customer service like this in all my life. In fact I would not even call it customer service. The service is non existent. Their motto of caring for people and health is simply meaningless. My extreme annoyance on Oura Ring’s respect towards their customers is beyond anything I thought was possible especially by a company who has become global. It’s as if pirates are working behind the scene! Something does not make sense. Something does not add up. Everyday a new celebrity face advert appears .. so they clearly have surplus funds BUT they have 0 courtesy to respond to client emails. I have been waiting for my ring for over 4 weeks. The day after I placed my order I changed my mind about the colour; from gold to silver. I have sent numerous emails and only one was replied to which did not respond to ANYTHING I asked. They have not refunded me the price difference between gold and silver. I have not received any confirmation email. I honestly cannot believe the level of disrespect and customer neglect. They charge an extortionate amount for the ring plus shipping etc. you then have to in In my case over 70 pounds duty to have it delivered. It’s so bizarre! Oura ring claims so much but delivers nothing! I haven’t even received my ring nearly 1 month on and I’ve had zero correspondence. I am disgusted! My mental capacity has gone down the drain. They do not care for their clients health. I’m extremely upset. I cannot believe I’ve had to even write this!

The price was clearly marked as both $ and USD on their main page, in my cart, and in the summary confirmation that was sent to me after.  At which point Paypal confirmed the transaction I could see the same number was used but now in Euros instead of USD.   When I let them know - including all of relevant screenshots - I was informed that all countries operate slightly different and produce their own price - or some other nonsense to this effect never mind the fact I had an actual email confirmation as well clearly displayed in USD.  When I escalated I was told someone would get back to me.   Days and weeks passed in between their responses and when they did arrive, they lacked both professionalism and content or any resolution.  They left the order active but unfulfilled for some weeks  then just refunded me when Paypal ultimately refunded the difference based on the screenshots I had also sent them.

I like that I can sync my Strava workouts and activities to Apple Health which then syncs to the Oura app. They are moving to a subscription model but offer a very generous six month free trial. I will have plenty of time to decide if it is worth the $6 per month and how the promised new features turn out.

I had to return for a smaller size and the return got lost in the mail.  I can't file a claim with FedEx because I didn't generate the shipping label.  Oura has to do it.  They do not have a customer service phone number, just a form to fill out.  I have filled out two online forms, reached out to them via Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.  Nothing has been resolved.  They say they are experiencing unprecedented customer service issues and are backlogged.  Well then, hire some more people asap and at least respond.  At least reassure your frustrated customers that you are working on it.  It is infuriating to spend so much $$ on something and not even have it and not be certain that I'm ever going to get it.

The sizing kit came to my address correctly - so they do have my correct address. Mid November I received the notice that the ring had shipped.  Long story short, the ring was sent to a non existent address (this has also happened to many other customers I have found out). The tracking number shows undeliverable address in another state and that it was returned to sender.  Over many weeks, I have e-mailed and messaged on Facebook dozens of times and tried every way possible to get to their customer service. For e-mail, I get the auto response ""it may take up to 7 days for customer support to respond to your issue"".  Those responses have gone on for 5 weeks!  When I message on FB, I get the reply ""please send more information"" with absolutely no other words - they don't say what info they want.  I have sent name, shipping address, tracking number, contact information, everything possible.  But, the only response is another auto response ""please send more information"".  They do NOT have a customer service phone number.

"Non existent product and customer service","Ordered a ring as a gift in mid November, the sizing kit arrived fine shortly thereafter and the recipient confirmed the size at the end of November. Then the issues started...a month later the recipient followed up because there had been no shipping notification and we had not been advised of any shipping delays. We were then informed the ring couldn't be shipped due to an address error despite the (uk) address being correct, the sizing kit having arrived successfully. The recipient replied saying the address was correct and asking oura to confirm what would happen. No reply came. I then followed up directly myself as the person who had placed the order, again nothing. I messaged them on instagram saying if they couldn't reply i wanted a refund, they said a refund would be provided. I followed up with ""customer services"" and they said they would refund but said it might take some time, they would not provide a timeframe and have since ignored my emails.

I work in tech and have seen better with the Apple healthkit app. A cardiologist reviewed oura sleep tracking and found it to be totally inaccurate. I found his review online and had the same poor experience. I bought this product for sleep data and it failed to track accurately or store the data at all. You are better off tracking sleep manually (as I have) with the help of a sleep therapist.Returned this ring two weeks ago for a full refund and have not received any reply or refund from them yet. Done with online only companies. They have no customer service number.

So far, 2 orders messed up, one canceled and no refund received, the other order still isn't fulfilled and NO ONE responds.This is by far the most frustrating experience I have ever had with customer (non-)service and I see Oura going out of business in no time.

"This company is disgusting","This company is disgusting . Dear customer service is the worst I have ever received in the history I have been dealing with customer service centres. I bought the new gen 3 ring it was shipped to me but the parcel was stolen I believe by someone who works for the shipping company they claim it was lost I don't believe it someone has my ring somewhere he shouldn't have it. The shipping company have admitted they have lost it so I told them I want compensation but apparently even though I'm the legal owner of the goods that doesn't matter the request for compensation has to be logged by The sender but the sender never bothers to reply so what am I meant to do this is caused me so much stress I am now taking both companies to the small claims court and will be claiming the compensation for the Lost ring as well as $2000 nzd in damages for stress and hurt feelings . If I could give a -100 I would . Their customer service is the pits . Avoid this company like the black plague because if anything goes wrong trying to get hold of them will be your worst nightmare.","1","2021-12-31T10:26:24.000Z","Tim Devaney","NZ","23.0"

"Not sure the Gen 2 Oura wasn't better","After using the Gen 2 Oura (which I got after the Mymotiv ring cratered at the same time that company went down) I liked it but was frustrated with it's often failure to sync with the phone app. So I was glad to see that Oura was enhancing the product and ordered a Gen 3, which I've had for about a month.Arghhh!The app has crashed, but that's minor compared to the dismal (+/- 1 day) battery charge life. You really need to pop this ring on its charger every time you sit down, not just to feed its ravenous battery but also because that's often the only way to get it to sync.I should add that I have - as recommended - disabled battery optimization.","1","2021-12-30T16:47:36.000Z","Crosby Norbeck","US","1.0"

Their customer support is just horrendous, incompetent, and frustrating.  I had two simple requests to fulfill during my order.  1) I needed to change my email address and 2) update my shipping. Both seemingly simple tasks right?  Nope!  I ended up getting my ring shipped to an address making it more difficult to get my ring and also now they won't let me change my primary email address.  Can you believe it? I can't even choose my own email address!  The company is absurd and now I wish I would have never upgraded and that's before I've even used the new Gen 3. I highly recommend staying from this company and wait to see if something changes.  As of 2021/2022, this company is the worst company I've ever dealt with.

I am a gym owner in great neck NY and love to try new trackers for better Clientele recommendation and perspective. I bought the oura gen 2 in September and not even a response from the company to inquire about wholesale pricing. furthermore about a month after I purchased the product the company began pushing gen 3, when I initially received my gen 2 I had asked if the ring tracked workouts and they said yes however buyer beware it only tracks workouts generically with straight math and input on you the users end. you input the amount of time you worked out for and it guesstimates an amount of kcals burned based off of activity type, guessed intensity and your BMI im assuming. that’s pretty weak if you ask me. oura is an incredible sleep tracker and apparently gen 3 was due to track workouts in real time so in spite of the company offering me no refund on my gen 2 purchase I went ahead and ordered gen 3. after my credit card was billed the company issued an email stating the 3rd gen ring will be tweaked and won’t have the workout tracing capacity. I’ve since sent back my gen 3 over 3weeks ago and upon doing so have discovered this company has disgraceful customer service. there is absolutely no phone to call, emails are carbon copy cut and paste which are truly aggravating and disingenuous. I still have no refund and haven’t been answered as to as to why . unfortunately I have to bash the company every way possible breccia’s on this day and age it’s a joke !

The measuring rings arrived in time BUT since then total radio silence. My new ring never arrived and no inquiry as to when I can expect it is being answered seriously. I cancelled the order - received an automated confirmation to my cancellation within minutes without anyone seemingly being even remotely interested in recovering me as a client. Client focus, client support, client information and customer care seem to have been lost completely with Oura and they are clearly champions in annoying loyal clients. Maybe their success has overwhelmed them and they are missing the opportunity to salvage the situation.

Poor service, so many attempts to contact Oura and DHL but no response. DHL finally – after a week said this shipment was handled by DHL express which apparently is different company and they cannot help. Oura on the other hand decided to not to communicate or respond to me (just an automated response with ticket number) Oura seem to be happy taking customers money and ignoring them, don’t really care if you even received the product. Oura failed several times, 1. No response to their customers despite several communications with them! Shocking!! . 2. Authorising DHL to charge extra fees for handling and not letting me know that there is Custom fees 3. Used incapable carrier such as DHL (or DHL express no one knows) despite bad DHL reputation – who charged me and sent the ring back to Oura. 4. Oura does not acknowledge there is a problem and not even reassuring me as a customer that they will sort this out. 5. This is very important Oura ring has no viable future compared with others similar products- I am almost certain Apple watch does many many more compared to Oura- apart from other functions at much better price and top quality customer service compared to Oura none existing customer care.

I have continued to contact them since November, it's now December 14th...So that leaves me even fewer days to return/exchange the product. The source of contact is email, Instagram, and app. I have corresponded every way possible. After many correspondence they replied stating that they'll send me the RMA #  (Return Mail Authorization), I still haven't received it... although I continue to request the RMA #...Oura continues to send redundant automated replies telling me to click the link ""initiate a return."" Once it populates to input my order number and email it states that I have passed the 30 day return policy. I email Oura back explaining the situation and the redundant emails start all over again. This has been the worst purchasing experience that I've encountered in my 50 something years, and that's a lot of purchasing experiences. This is completely unexceptionable. At this point I don't want the product anymore. The remainder of my life is more valuable then having to deal with this. Purchasing a product is supposed to be an exciting and joyful experience. Oura sure knows how to take the ""JOY"" out of joyful!","5","2022-04-21T00:04:57.000Z","Samantha Haas","US","2.0"

"Poor Customer Service","Like many other reviewers I have fallen victim to Oura.I was an existing v2 user and liked their ring and recommended the v3 update to several friends and ordered my self.When I ordered their website clearly stated VAT/Import duties were included in the price. This was misrepresented and they subsequently changed their website.I cancelled the order and they promised a refund within 3 business days. However several weeks later I have still not received anything. All you get is canned responses from their customer service.This is such a shame to see a company like this go down hill.I am currently having to try and get my money back through my credit card.","1","2021-12-11T17:57:22.000Z","James","GB","4.0"
"This is a scam","THIS IS A SCAM! I ordered a ring in September, they sent a sizing kit but when I uploaded my size all communication went dead. I contacted them to ask for shipping confirmation for the ring but no response. Eventually after posting several messages on their website I started getting generic automated email responses. Having paid €330 I would expect some customer service but no - not this company. They behave more like a scam drop shipper. I therefore cancelled my order. I had to submit several requests before I eventually got an email on Nov 6th advising that my order would be cancelled and refunded. Now in December I have received no refund or no further communication.","1","2021-12-11T16:24:22.000Z","Mike Kelliher","IE","1.0"

"Unresponsive support and incompetent order process equals no usable product","I bought an Oura ring 29 of September 01. I received the sizing kit within a month. I confirmed my size and ordered the ring on October 6. Then I get a second sizing kit without explanation. I go check my order status and it says to confirm size. What?! I already did that. I confirm again, not realizing that they apparently changed the sizes and had sent me a newer Gen 3 size kit. While this might have felt like a nice gesture to them, this was just a foolish thing to do in the midst of a confirmed and open order with a pending status. So between Gen 2 and Gen 3 the sizes just also have changed a lot (wouldn’t Oura know this conversion themselves and not need to send two kits and expect me to figure out what was going on?!)I then get a ring that can’t even fit on my pinky. Support tells me to initiate an exchange. The status of the order, two weeks later the order asays “not yet shipped”. So then I finally get something to show as eligible for a return only and the eligibility date as being nearly a month in the past. Numerous unanswered emails to support. How we do one thing is how we do most things. I can’t imagine the tech and software for the ring that tracks health vitals can be all that good or trusted and reliable if a company can’t even get the shipping ordering and exchange tech down properly. That and the unanswered support emails tells me all I need to know. Now I can’t exchange and only return the ring that I was supposed to be able to get one free size exchange on. Again, no explanation. This is a product that is heavy on marketing but seemingly pretty lacking on follow through when it comes to caring for customers and getting products reliably into customer hands. So now, after three months, I’m back to no product and just lots of time and energy wasted trying.

The ring was swiftly delivered like was my wife’s ring (she ordered a month later).

"Terrible / non existent customer service","I ordered a ring and paid £15 for delivery. On their website the FAQ say it is £15 to the UK so I read no further. Well, it turns out that the price of the ring plus shipping does not include import duties and other god knows what costs that businesses normally pay to the shipping provider. Altogether another £55 I had to pay to DHL!At first I thought it was a scam so I emailed customer service multiple times but got no response. There’s no number to call and seemingly they don’t answe emails, so you’re totally on your own once you click buy. I was going to return it, but to get a refund I had to return the ring to them, which I didn’t have. And there’s no way to contact them, so in the end I took the additional £55 hit because I thought it’s better to get the ring for an extra £55 than get nothing for £200+. Anyway, on reading the Oura small print it does say that customers have to cover this cost themselves, but it’s hidden away and the awful customer service made it all round a horrible experience.","1","2021-12-07T20:40:44.000Z","Ryan","GB","2.0"

I have reached out to the customer service email several times and they closed the ticket without addressing the issue.  Now I want to return both rings due to the lack of quality customer service but no one responds. The online return order system is not working and I would love a simple return address but they do not have a customer support response team who is actually answering customer support issues- instead it seems like an automated chatbot and no phone number available to speak with a live person.

"Not very accurate at recording sleep patterns","I have the Gen 3 version of the ring. The beauty of this product is that its easy to wear all the time and track your body activity. The downside is that it doesnt really work in some respects and at night you can wake up and lie awake for hours whilst the ring records you as being asleep. The consequence is that the algorithms then tell you that you are 'ready for anything today' when in fact you could be completely knackered ! I contacted the company who basically said I was right and that it doesnt always work...!  What they should do is provide a way for you to edit your recorded sleep patterns so that perhaps the sensors could learn your individual patterns and report better. Maybe a future refinement - but this weakness does reduce the value of the ring somewhat.","3","2021-12-07T15:31:12.000Z","Nico","GB","25.0"

"Total disappointment","I didn't own a Gen 2 ring, but I guess they were ok, product-wise. I bought a Gen 3 after Tim Ferriss promoted Oura on his podcast. The Gen 3 ring that I got is not a functioning product, it cannot connect to the phone via bluetooth and it simply does not work (cannot be set up). I am not making this claim lightly. I did spend several hours trying to find a solution online and troubleshooting the issue. I tried everything, eventually even tried different phones, and nothing works. I am sure there are people with perfectly functioning Gen 3 ring, but based on what I read online, quite many people didn't get that lucky. My guess is that they choose to get the new generation out before X-mass no matter what and released a half-baked, buggy product. To add insult to injury, Oura support really is non-existent, they provided no reply when I asked them about the issue. I personally don't mind the price, the subscription model, or the delayed shipping. I can be very patient with support, especially around this time of the year. But I now view Oura as mostly a great PR stunt, covering a disaster of a company and a flawed product.","1","2021-12-06T12:16:12.000Z","Vojtech","CZ","1.0"

They promised to process my refund within a few days, but it's already been three weeks.Many buyers on social networking sites have complained that their refunds have been withheld for more than a month, so it is not surprising that they suspect a scam.When I contacted customer support again to request a refund, I was told that ""refunds are handled by a different team,"" but isn't it the role of support to find out when a refund will be processed?The quality of the products and apps seems to have a certain reputation, but unfortunately the support is one of the worst on the earth.","1","2021-12-06T02:12:55.000Z","Takehiko Ono","JP","1.0"

I could not select my ring size on the link they sent me. I can therefore not finalise my order. It should be simple issue. I have tried to resolve this now for 3 weeks. I liked the Oura ring a lot, but I am completely disillussioned by their customer service. How is this even possible? I really don't get it.  I am on the brink of cancelling my order. Don't even know whether they would respond to that.","1","2021-12-03T11:18:54.000Z","Dr Jay","GB","1.0"
"Garbage company","Cancelled my order, the customer service is the WORST I have ever experienced. If I could put 0 stars I would, I have wrote them mulitiple times throughout the past few months since the rings were on back order and all I received were automated responses with the exact same message. It wasn't until I voiced how upset I was until I actually got a response. Do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this, the product is probably amazing but Oura killed the experience by not doing the simple things. Extremely disappointing.","1","2021-12-02T23:36:10.000Z","Jeff","US","1.0"

"Terrible customer support and misrepresentation","My Gen 2 ring (purchased in April 2020) stopped working two months ago (in Oct 2021) when it wouldn't hold a charge. I got in touch with Oura customer service to get a replacement and they said rings produced during a specific date range (my ring was in this group) had known faulty batteries and they offered me a Gen 3 replacement. This was great so far. They asked me about sizing and offered to send a new sizing kit, which I declined. I sent them my shipping address on Nov 9th and that was the last I've heard from them despite numerous follow up emails. At this point, they're ignoring all incoming support requests and it's appalling. For a company that prides itself on putting their customers first, it's very disappointing.

"Buyer beware!","My wife and I have Oura gen2 rings, which were pre-ordered long before production, more than three years ago, we are long established customersWhen I saw gen3 was available and Oura gave me an upgrade offer (€50 off and free subscription), I took itThe sizing kit arrived promptly enough, but seems exactly the same as the two we already have - waste of time, money and environmental considerationsI updated my order for a size 9 (yes, exactly the same as my gen2) and was delighted to receive the gen3 ring, via DHL around 4 days laterUnfortunately, they shipped a size 11, which is way too big for me, so I immediately replaced the ring in the packaging and created a support ticket asking for an RMA - they can send me the correct ring and a label to give the old one back to the DHL guy when he delivers, simple!That was November 18th, it's now December 1st, I've had no response from Oura. Only thing is that their chatbot on Twitter, where I'm also complaining, said my case ""has been escalated""Well god help those that aren't escalated, because, nope, nothingNow I'm very much considering just sticking with my gen2 and requesting a refund. I had two replacement gen2 rings due to the battery issue, but in that case the customer service was efficient and friendly, I can't imagine the hassle if the gen3 has issuesAnd all this from a Scandinavian company too, it's shockingBuyer beware!","1","2021-12-01T21:24:15.000Z","Dave Baird","BE","3.0"
"Very disappointed when I should be excited.","Update:  my ring was shipped and received and I am learning the functionality.  I do like the device.I still am not thrilled about the marketing sending out $50 discount emails after I ordered yet it appears there is quite a backlog of product.  I will be awaiting to see if perhaps the company offers lifetime membership to those of us who ordered at launch only to learn it was later discounted to new customers who did not order right away…everyone except us.  Then I’ll consider submitting a better review. Original review:I wanted this ring a year ago but opted for the Amazon Halo wrist band. Decided this year to get the ring. Then saw the gen 3 was coming out so I waited. I ordered and they promptly took my money. I did not get confirmation of my order so I inquired. Five days later I got a confirmation of my order and the date was also delayed, but at least I’m in the system. They sent a sizing kit and I submitted my size. Then They sent an email saying my order status would be updated in two weeks. Not shipped…updated. That made me nervous. Then I see many other customers complaining with no replies. Then they send out an offer for $50 off. Wait!  Since they never sent my ring can I get that deal?  They ask me to send screenshots of the email I got. What?  You don’t know what your company is sending out?  It appears that was just a stall tactic. Still can’t get an answer on my order a month later. They have my money.

I’m sure it will be in some small print somewhere in their process, but it is certainly NOT made evident when they email you to say the product has been shipped to you. Be VERY aware before you deal with this company that they are not upfront and border on being devious with their customers. Customer service help emails suddenly stop arriving swiftly once you have actually bought and paid for the ring and you suddenly realise that you have another bill to pay to receive the ring.

"Worse customer service experience ever …","I purchased a generation 2 ring without any problems. So I was more than willing to upgrade to the gen 3. I was offered a discount, not great considering my gen 2 ring wasn’t even three months old, but a discount and also free lifetime membership, which I thought would make up for the poor discount offer and so went for it.That’s where the issues began and just didn’t seem to end.Initially, although my basket showed the promised discount and the free lifetime membership, my card was charged full price and my receipt didn’t mention any kind of membership.Sadly, it took way too much stress and far too many emails to try and get this sorted out and as a last resort I started a credit card chargeback.Then they miraculously issued the discount as a part refund. Still no mention of the free lifetime membership.However, the problems and poor communication just continued to roll on in.After waiting for the ring sizer to arrive, which by the way is exactly the same sizing as the gen 2 and not really necessary, the website would not update with my ring size no matter how many times I tried or emailed them.By this time, with all the stress, I am definitely ready to just cancel and go for a different device. You really do have to experience it to believe it and know what I’m talking about. I am almost certain that this was set up this way on purpose to stall.So I tried and tried to cancel the ring. Nothing. Not a single response until I again contacted my credit card company to start the chargeback process again.I then miraculously got an email confirming my sizing as per my many emails.The ring finally came. Actually it came quite quickly by comparison and considering all the other issues and unanswered emails. I just can’t celebrate it. It’s much too little and far too late.The actual ring:I do like it and it seems better than the gen 2 ring but my purchasing experience has soured it so much that I can’t enjoy it.Because as well, as if the above wasn’t bad enough, the membership that I have isn’t lifetime it’s six months and I am still fighting this one out. If I don’t get what was promised in my upgrade email the I will definitely contact my credit card company, cancel the order and get a full refund, duties included.I will not be ripped off or messed around any longer.So, I tried to contact them to cancel again as I never buy any gadgets that have subscriptions attached (they’re just outright rips off) and I was sent so many fluffy email replies (not one of them actually answered my questions around when I would get the lifetime membership promised in my upgrade email).So, I have decided to cancel and return.I expect after this poor customer service this company cannot survive.","1","2021-11-26T16:58:37.000Z","Denise Mijatovic","GB","1.0"

And I recevied my ring (in Germany) one week after it started selling. I didn't need customer service. I just waited out the storm. From my past experience I'd really suggest being a bit paitent. Oura is a small company that focusses on their product and that's why we love it. It now had a major rollout and thus is a little overwhelmed.

I was offered to pay an extra $200 to upgrade to Gen 3 only weeks after they sent me an obsolete product.  2 weeks later they shipped my friend the Gen3 instead of a Gen 2 as a thank you for being patient. Customer service hasn’t read my emails, they send canned messages about the new ring and the “exciting upgrade offer” which is only good for Oura. They don’t care about their customers, providing a good experience, or admitting the truth about their operations.","1","2021-11-20T19:58:58.000Z","Anne Caulkins","US","1.0"

BTW, when a company says ""due to higher than normal..."", that is management speak for ""we do not prepare well"".

"Unethical","On October 26, 2021, Oura Ring came out with a new Gen3 ring model, rendering the Gen2 model legacy. When Oura launched the new product, they had a generous exchange policy on their support website. It said that if a customer purchased a Gen2 ring anytime between April 20th and October 26, then they are eligible for a free upgrade. I reached out to Oura Support to initiate this process, and I was told that that was not the policy. I was confused by this reply so I sent them the screenshot of their policy and asked for a follow-up. They stopped replying to me completely. Later, I checked their support website again and they changed the Gen3 ring upgrade policy overnight. Now it says that we are “eligible for a discounted upgrade”, and no longer an “exchange”. They screwed over early customers for more money.","1","2021-11-12T19:09:21.000Z","Kevin Y","US","2.0"

"Was about to order the Oura Ring in…","Was about to order the Oura Ring in September until the Oura Twitter account tweeted “WAGMI” which is an acronym for “We Are Gonna Make It”. This led me to believe that the next Gen is on the horizon. I DM’d the Twitter account to ask if the new version was in the works and they said to stay tuned to the newsletter for information about the next ring update. So I did, I waited, and the Gen 3 was launched a month after!However, because of that conversation, I waited a few weeks for the Gen 3 and was surprised by a new subscription model UNLESS you purchased the ring previously, which I would have done had it not been for the Tweets and DMs from the Oura Twitter account. I explained my situation to them in DMs and they empathized and asked me to forward my situation to a support email address that they provided me with to have someone help me with my situation, but all I got from thag email was a generic response of their FAQs. I finally got a response from a human representative only for them to not be aware of the back and forth conversation through Tweets and DMs with the Twitter account and did not address to find a solution to my situation at all. Since then, they have been radio silent in both email or Twitter responses. This is been one of the worst customer experiences I’ve had with any company. To think that I went from being incredibly excited to join the Oura community and recommending family and friends to join me to being where I am now with how negatively I feel about this company is shocking. This launch was poorly planned, with a huge lack of communication and transparency. I will be taking this up with the BBB if my situation continues to go unaddressed and unresolved.","1","2021-11-04T19:46:37.000Z","Daniel Lam","CA","2.0"

So I was supposed to receive the notification through email with a personal link to update to a gen3 ring the mentioned discount and lifetime free membership but I never received any email or notification. I wrote so many emails and messages but each time I received the same message that the email will arrive or already sent that I should keep on checking my inbox again and after several same kind of answer someone finally replied that If I haven’t received anything that means that I just haven’t been qualified for lifetime free membership and discount and that they’re sorry for the decision…So frustrating the Worst customer experience of my life, it’s really a shame and a pity knowing that I was a fan and recommending the product before that happened and I was ready to purchase the new ring.

"Completely unacceptable customer…","Completely unacceptable customer service.My Oura ring arrived September 13th.  The first day I put it on I emailed the company and asked why my vitals were not showing up.  I learned through the response that heartrate, etc. was captured only when I was sleeping; not sure how I missed that detail, but I did.  I was also sent a link to an article explaining that capturing vitals while I am awake is too hard.  Fast forward to October 26th and WOW, the company is offering the impossible - AND I can pay $200 more.  We exchanged too many preformatted response ""customer service"" emails before I received an email this morning by someone claiming that ""...we did not have concrete details about Gen 3 rings..."".  I also used FB Messenger to communicate with Oura, but I haven't heard back (yet); frankly, I don't expect any better answer if I do.Neat technology, but if this company is selling a luxury item (or at least one for people with disposable income) - then they need to do a MUCH better job.  The preformatted email responses are ridiculous, the claim that their own employees could not advise their customers so close to a new product release is ridiculous and unless this ring fails ahead of its expected lifecycle I don't think this purchase could go worse.11.2 Update:  Received a FB message ""...We experienced a huge amount of interest in the Oura Ring Gen3 launch, so we have a higher than usual influx of inquiries. We ask for your patience as we work to get back to everyone as quickly as we can...""11.17 Update: Nothing heard here or via FB.

"Sneaky business practices","I like the ring, but am posting this review as Oura has started to roll out sneaky business practices with planned obsolescence of the Oura 2 ring, reduced feature sets in the Oura 2 following release of the Oura 3, and stopping functionality up to 2 years from now (as a reference point, Apple gives 7 years for iPhones). This feels like a bait-and-switch, and I am deeply disappointed. I hope they’ll realise their mistake and roll back these changes, but until then, I would strongly advise against buying an Oura ring and getting into their ecosystem if this is how they treat their customers.","1","2021-10-30T12:03:19.000Z","Andrew","GB","4.0"
"Forced membership that makes the hardware useless, because you can't access its data","When I pre-ordered my 3rd gen ring, I thought that the new membership model is optional after the 6 free months. I was under the impression that you only need to pay the monthly fee to get extra features in the app like videos, meditations etc. since I'm perfectly capable to interpret the data for myself or use third party apps like Welltory, Autosleep for data visualization.Now I read that they are even hiding the raw data output behind the paywall and no way to use the data from the ring like I want to! That's totally unacceptable! I'm not paying a high price for a hardware that I'm not able to use after 6 months! That's literally like buying a new TV that you are not able to use because you have to pay for Netflix to use it! Seriously, what have they been thinking??I canceled my pre-order immediately after I read about this issue.

I’ve put many friends  and family on to this product. However, the durability is questionable. I was in Alaska hiking,  and was traveling down a challenging trail, when we was climbing and was pulling myself up from a rock when my ring  broke.  I reached out to Oura to see if you would be able to replace my ring with no fees considering I received the ring less than a year ago and would fit under warranty I didn’t have a picture of  the broken ring as it fell off and landed somewhere I couldn’t find considering where I was! No changes are needed , only a replica of the stealth heritage that I had. CUSTOMER SERVICE should be important to most companies, doesn’t seem it’s a priority for this one. This was the response “ Unfortunately your case is not covered under warranty but I would like to offer a discount” you give discounts to people who dont even have rings! So, my response to the rep was “  wanted to inquire as to why the ring wouldn’t be under warranty if it was less than a year? When climbing,  the ring had cracked and broke as I was grabbing a rock. The durability and workmanship of the ring should of withstood the climb, as I used the ring in accordance to the purpose and with no abuse. I would of course love to get another stealth ring that I had, but my circumstances financially has changed over this year, would make it difficult to purchase another ring”. I guess there response to my message was nothing! No response and still waiting ! Way to treat clients that advocate your product! I’ll make sure to get out what this company really stands for! There bottom line with a B.S mission who dont care about the their customers!

All we had to do was adjust online when we confirmed the size after using the sizing kit.Well guess what, no way to change color online when confirming size. We had to email ""Customer Support"" with our order number and our requested colors and sizes.Customer Support emailed us back confirming the order with the wrong color. We emailed them again.. and again the emailed back the wrong color. So we emailed them a third time and the emailed us back with the correct color and sizes, but that our order had been placed on-hold.It has now been a week, we have emailed and messaged on IG and FB and still no response. Our next step is to contact our credit card company and have them deal with them.My wife and I were so excited to get these rings.. the total lack of customer service,  not to mention no way to call, has turned this anniversary present into nothing but frustration. I cannot recommend this product purely on the lack of adequate communication or customer support.","1","2021-10-01T20:08:59.000Z","David S. Huffstetler","US","1.0"

"A number of annoying flaws","I like getting the ring's feedback but find a number of flaws really annoying. They added a feature to capture naps resulting it saying I'm asleep (even deep sleep) when I watch TV. Totally screws up the validity of the sleep feedback. Also it labels my lowest heartrate of the night as a ""recovery"" indicator but it always simply corresponds with me being awake and practicing deep breathing to go back to sleep. It's also annoying to have an algorithm choose ""my goals"" and then ding me for not meeting them. One bizarre flaw is that the day after I workout long and hard, I get dinged for the previous days poor activity level. What the hell?And why does it set a goal for me to go bed at 8:30 or 9pm? That's ridiculous. It constantly tells me I have zero REM sleep when I always am aware of dreaming when I awake at any point during the night. Bottomline is that you have to take all readings with a big grain of salt. I also wear a Fitbit and appreciate the additional input.","3","2021-09-23T18:39:54.000Z","Linda Galliher","US","1.0"

"Fantastic service!","Fantastic service!Had an issue with the battery, seems a common fault but with technology this small I guess it would be. Anyway, I reached out to oura about 10 days ago (sept 2021) and they took a look at the data at their end and confirmed I had a battery issue.  They asked a few questions and we had a few email exchanges. They're a few hours behind (or maybe ahead) of us in the UK but the responses were all timely. Anyway, long and short they confirmed the battery had an issue and couldn't be fixed so they'd send me a new ring. I've had the original since maybe Jan 20, possibly Dec 19, but a little under 2 years anyway. Said replacement has just come in the post today, so end to end it's been maybe 2 weeks. All of the horror stories I'm reading about their customer service, that just hasn't been my experience.  So either they've sorted their CS out or the reviews on here have been from exceptionally unlucky people. Personally I can't commend them highly enough.  The way I see this, the battery has lasted 18 months or so, the replacement was a freebie, so if that lasts 18 months more then I'll have had 3 years out of this piece of tech, which in tech terms is very good. (most people don't keep tech much beyond a year, think phones etc). So 3 years for a single cost of maybe 250 quid I think is superb On a note I have to say i really love the app too, it's been an excellent companion every morning, suggesting how well I slept, monitoring my temp and HR and them measuring how active I am during the day. I have a fitbit as a companion for this ring but I feel the oura app is better (for me). Long and short I really can't recommend this product, or oura's superb after sales service enough","5","2021-09-17T15:13:10.000Z","paul wilson","GB","26.0"

"Ouraring does not succeed to track HR","My brand new ouraring does not track my heart rate during sleep.  I have been in touch w Oura Support and have taken actions on their recommendations but it still does not work. Oura support claims there´s nothing wrong with the ring but can not tell me how to get it to work. They do not accept this issue as a warranty claim but offer a replacement ring under their replacement clause (replacement allowed once per purchase in case you got the size wrong). How will a replacement ring solve my problem if nothing is wrong with my existing ring? Update 17 sept 2021: after several attempt to contact oura support w/o success,  I reached out w an insta DM as suggested by their reply here at trustpilot and I finally got through to Cora at Oura Support. Despite our joint efforts in getting my HR detection going during sleep, we did not succeed. But when I tried the ring on my daughter, HR detection worked fine all night (!) so the ring is not broken, it is just the HR detection technology which does not work on me!All in all, oura support was welcoming and friendly (once I got through to the relevant person - their different support channels are not fully synced...) and the ring, well, I like the idea and product but it did not work out for me personally!","2","2021-09-17T09:13:34.000Z","Kastrand","SE","9.0"

On top of that I had to pay £6.80 exchange fee from my bank.  That amounts to a further £75 extra and I'm refusing delivery.I would say your business model is seriously flawed if you expect UK customers to pay these charges and wait a week for the kit and another for the ring.  It would suggest to me you don't have the logistical set up for what I'd have thought would be a major market.  I now have to apparently request to cancel my order ( you have to pay upfront just to get the sizing kit).  Request?  Isn't that a statutory right?

They had the audacity to offer me a $50 discount for a new ring to make up for it!  To sum it all up, the Oura ring pretty much costs about $150 per year...which is about the same price as replacing a high-end smartphone.  I would highly recommend staying away from this product.

I was able to exchange and am awaiting arrival of replacement product.  Thanks to Joel from OURA that helped expedite this process.Received the replacement in timely manner and without issue.

"So I felt that after a year of use I…","So I felt that after a year of use I would share my experience with this incredible ring concept. I received my first ring in August. My sizing was required to be a size 7 which would be on my left index and middle finger depending on winter and summer. In December the ring stopped charging altogether and it took two weeks with support to get my new ring issues settled and a new one sent. And then new ring worked fine for about six months when the Bluetooth stopped working and the gold coloring that I paid an extra hundred bucks for was completely wearing off. Again I was under warranty and it took several weeks to get the issue cleared before I could ship my order back and receive a new one. It took only two days to receive the new one once shipped(a rapid response I must say). Now, unfortunately, my 3rd ring in just over a year) the size is inconsistent. Whereas the previous size seven was slightly snug to generally snug on my left index and middle finger this one is loose and falling off both fingers. It says that it is a size 7 but there's no way that is correct. I tried on the demo ring again in case my finger size changed(doubtful at 55 years old).  The size seven demo fits perfectly. I am barely able to wear this without falling off and I know I'll not be able to wear this in the winter unless I flip it over to my dominant hand which I would prefer not to do because again it would wear off the coloring.  Love the tech concept and really love the data but have I been fraught with issues of gold color wearing off with usual daily activity, battery failing on the first ring, blue tooth and color failing on second(replacement under warranty) and now my 3rd ring size is too big and not accurate. Hmmm very frustrating indeed.","2","2021-08-29T16:42:44.000Z","Julia Bowlin","US","5.0"

"Oura ring good for 8-9 months only.","Edit final:25th Aug I received the second warranty replacement ring. This was sorted out much more quickly than the first.  And as Oura are happy to point out on their website, the battery is a consumable and not reason for warranty. This second ring, like the first, clearly failed due to BT or other chipset. I personally believe complaining here on a public forum sped up the replacement and encourage others to do the same if their ring fails. Meanwhile, I’ve lost two more weeks of data.  And the only real usefulness of these kinds of devices is the long term baseline they create. Summary: very solid software/UI. Helpful information for better living.  Poor hardware - they should invest in more robust chipsets even if it raises the rings price. MTBF should never be less than 24 months.  Edit: 20th Aug.  Oura warranty team inform me that they will send a replacement ring. ""warranty orders are moved to top of their shipping queue.""  Shipping normally within 1 week. Edit 19th Aug.  Oura support say, ""After reviewing your Oura Ring's data, we have discovered an issue with your ring"".  Then proceed to tell me to inform them of my ring details, including order number (this second faile ring is a warranty replacement of the first) so that my order can be referred to their warranty support team for review.  Takes 2-3 business days. Edit:  18th Aug, Oura support respond on 16th Aug with their standard form ""is it plugged in"" script as nearly all first line support teams are forced to do.  We're still answering their questions.  The ring's bluetooth still is not visible on any device (iOS or Android) with all other 2.4Ghz radio sources isolated. Perhaps the battery is too weak to turn on BT, perhaps bt chip died.  I'm waiting for them to tell me that this replacement ring is out of warranty. Edit after Ouraring comment on my review below:Ouraring support. I never said battery.  First ring failed during firmware update.  Second ring just lost BT Connectivity. Both rings still show white led on charging base - eg not a battery issue. Both failures are your core hardware, not the battery. Stop trying to cover things up and fix the poor hardware builds. If you have so much time to troll the blogosphere - then you should rewrite your public FAQ stating the “battery life” story you explain below.  And answer my support question that I opened in the app on the 14th. Original review entered 14 Aug 2021:Bought a used Oura from Finnish secondhand market. December 2019. Worked great. The guy I bought it from had used it for two months.  Did it’s thing like it says. Until it failed in September 2020. Thirty days of “customer service” frustration and they sent a replacement. November 2020 all is good again.  Mid August 2021 ring stops connecting. Of course the question is why bother. The data is good. But 8-9 months from a piece of tech.  It’s poor. No wonder the price is steep - it’s not the materials or development. It’s the cost of replacement!! Horrible.","1","2021-08-28T09:26:47.000Z","Johnjhelsinki","FI","1.0"

"Oura Ring a Great Product- With a FATAL flaw.","Great Product.  Awesome Product actually.  Why only a 1 star you might ask ?Take the below advise from an early adopter. Here is my Oura Ring review. I have brought 5 Oura rings for friends and referred another 10 odd people. So yeah I was a real fan and promoter ( Which I wish I had not now)  Warning: The Orua Ring has one FATAL flaw.  As you can see from the growing number of negative reviews on what is / should be a best in class productThe ring battery will die on you, its not a matter of IF just a matter of WHEN.  It is not changeable, so you have to buy a complete new ring.  So simply put it is a disposable product. If you are UNLUCKY your ring will last 2 years and probably die very soon after. After 2 years you are out of the warranty period, so tough luck. ( Not that I have heard of one lasting 2 years. )If you are lucky, as I was, the ring will fail at about 14-16 months which is standard from what I can see. I got a brand new warranty replacement and the battery lasted 14 months.  So I got 2.5 years use out of 2 rings and others I know of  that brought rings over a year or so ago have had to get replacements because of the battery issues. I think that Oura needs to address this up front with potential clients.  As long as they some how get you to 2 years. They will simply walk away, with full knowing on the day you purchased it that the battery was going to fail.Hope on the next version they address, it as apart from that fatal flaw,  I am a fan of the product. I just hope that the business can survive till V3 with the battery issues resolved.And check the yet to be posted ""canned reply"".  It will be a copy and paste.  So don't take it like they actually want to own this issue.Edit to response:  Yes a pretty much canned reply. Lets address it :""such as the age of your ring"" All the rings I am aware of are Brand New ""usage of ring features ""   (e.g. Moment)  A new feature on Andriod that was used a Total of ZERO times on my first failed ring ""completing a firmware update, ""  I would think this was a joke, if they were not repeating it over and over. .  They are pushing their own software to their own ring once every month or so that destroys the battery.   LOL ""have a limited lifespan"" Yes in Oura rings case VERY LIMITED Beware this is not like when a phone battery dies. When this battery goes it goes to unusable in light speed.","1","2021-06-18T03:52:58.000Z","Al Hall","NZ","11.0"
"Buyer","Buyer - be aware of this product and bad customer service.In 2019 I got my Oura Ring after 6 month from order date.After 7 month my ring started to have connections failures and charging problems. I contacted Oura Ring after a few month and then started a longer period of mailing and waiting for answers from Oura RingThe latest answer was that the Warranty agent would contact me, but I never happened.So beware!","1","2021-06-13T19:15:12.000Z","Hannah Ottesen","DK","4.0"
"GREAT PRODUCT - Does have battery issues & you have to fight for your rights","UPDATED - After much chasing, Oura finally came back to me & denied honouring my warranty. But I wouldn't accept this. In the end, they replaced my ring under warranty & I am now pleased to say I have a new ring. I look forward to seeing how this one goes. I hope that my first one was just faulty & this one lasts more than 6 months.My advice - don't be prepared to give up. If you have an issue then insist that they replace it.Such a shame as I love the ring but I just can't be enthusiastic about the after care & warranty process.However, I finally got there & I have given 4 stars on that basis.BUYER BEWARE - this product will only be effective for around 3-6 months!I love the idea of the Oura ring & I love the data it gives me. However, I bought mine brand new (still wrapped) from someone on eBay. It was a genuine Oura ring & like I said the wrapping wasn't even opened so I was the first person to own it & use it. However, after less than 6 months, the battery started to fail & rather than getting 2-3 days, I was lucky to get 1 day from it. I contacted Oura & they said that they could only replace it if I could supply the serial number & the purchase receipt. I contacted the bay seller but they didn't have the receipt. What I don't understand is that with me syncing to the Oura software every day they can access the serial number & they can see the first time it was used. They can see that it failed in less than 6 months but they won't do anything about it because I don't have a receipt. So, I spent $500 on a ring that is effectively useless after 6 months and I can't get any support for it. BTW - it's now not even holding a charge for a day so my $500 ring was useful for less than 6 months, partially useful for the next few months & now effectively a dud.A lot of money for a very poor product & poor service :(I know that I didn't buy it from a store but as with all electronics that sync each day, Oura has full information on my product & its history so it's disappointing that they won't do anything about it.REFERENCE: 439655","4","2021-07-13T08:15:59.000Z","Debra Chantry-Taylor","NZ","1.0"

"If you need Customer Service, you won't find it here...","These devices are a little on the expensive side, so held off purchasing for quite a while.  Finally decided to take the plunge and purchased a Steal Black version.  Shipping occurred within a couple of days with delivery to my home by the end of the week; however, this is where things went wrong.  Shipping DHL with and handoff to USPS.  Well, DHL states they handed it off to USPS, but USPS has no record of that.  OK, no big deal, shipping snafus happen.  Contacted Oura support, waited over 2 days for a non-helpful response.  Still no updates on shipping status.  Once I did hear back, they stated they ""escalated to shipping department"", but that was 3 days ago, crickets.  Still no updates on shipping status.  I'm unable to contact anyone at Oura and they have my $399.  I think I'm going to bail and cancel/return the ring, but I'm betting that is going to take weeks as well.  Delivery was supposed to be over a week ago at this point so it's likely never arriving.  Customer service is horrible.  When you sell a premium product for a premium price, it should be backed up by some decent customer service.  Instead I'm left with $399 out of pocket and no way to get in touch with the company.  Guess it's off to the credit card company to dispute the charges.","1","2021-06-09T20:45:36.000Z","Scott","US","1.0"
"Stung with large import duty to UK","If you are a UK buyer please be aware of the import duty/vat (£54.86) which you will receive in the post months after your purchase. Although the company do state at the point of order that there will be import charges for some countries, there is no indication of quite how substantial this is. I for one had no experience or understanding of the scale of the charge, presuming VAT was in the price. They may have fulfilled a legal obligation with this disclaimer, but it's pretty shoddy customer service, not to make this more transparent, as it is a new T&C as a result of Brexit. Surprising for a company that seems to pride itself on the support for the use of the ring. Somewhat tarnished the whole experience.......Addendum - I've just done some research and (according to Which) it seems that no duty is charged on products manufactured in the EU - so I am a little confused as to why DHL have billed me this long after delivery, and why Oura themselves were not able to point this out to me....","1","2021-06-06T17:22:11.000Z","morny wright","GB","9.0"
"Problems Faced by One of Oura's First Customers","I am one of Oura's 1st customers. As a former personaI trainer, I highly anticipated product and ordered it in December 2018. Although I helped consult as an independent contractor on Amazon’s Halo fitness band, I fully subscribed to the promise of Oura’s technology and ability to advance the fitness industry. I've had 2 (now maybe 3 because it has stopped working) rings that have broken even though I have taken exceptional care of the rings. There always seems to be an issue (not changing, not syncing, poor battery life, etc)Aside from the hardware, I have faced a number of other customer service issues:For example, I originally ordered the silver ring - which scratchs easily. Because of this, I regularly take off my ring when exercising / lifting and have to manually input data. After my 1st & 2nd rings broke, I asked that the replacements be sent in black because the silver scratches so easily and looks terrible. However, they said this was impossible. This made no sense as regardless of color, the ring is the same price/model- a seemingly minor request was made out to be a big deal and ignored.  I hope things can be resolved. But for now I have recommending my training clients to use fitbit and the Amazon halo band to track fitness/health. I have been continuing to use the Oura ring because I cannot stand wearing bands/watches on my wrist. But if this third ring is not fixed/resolved, I will likely have to move on and find a different product.","2","2021-06-02T14:49:57.000Z","Cameron Huard","US","1.0"
"wrong shipping address and no helpful reply from Oura","Bought a ring with shipping address in Italy and payment address in UK. Received payment confirmation and shipping confirmation emails, both indicating shipping addreess in Italy. Then i received an email from Royal Mail telling me that the ring was being received in the UK for UK delivery. Sent 1st  email to customer service attaching both order confirmation and shipping confirmation email. Customer service  replied I could not change the shipping address selected whilst ordering; obviously didnt read my email as i was NOT asking to ship to a different address, I was asking to ship exactly to the address i selected whilst ordering. I sent email nr 2 where I tried to explain the Mistake the company had done in shipping the item to a different country. No reply. So i sent a 3rd email, repeating what had happened and asking the company to redress their mistake.  I have not received an answer yet.

"A happy experience with Oura customer service.","Bought a ring at Christmas, love it (data geek). Only problem - the battery suddenly died after 6 months. Looking at the umpteen negative reviews here I suspected this might turn out to have been an expensive and short lived experiment. However, an email to Oura about the problem got a reply overnight asking for more details. The next day they followed up (presumably having looked up data from the ring) to say ""yes, the battery has failed, a replacement ring will be sent ASAP, just recycle the old one, we don't need it back"". A week later, the new ring arrived and is now happily setting up.  Only 4 stars because ideally, the original ring wouldn't have died so soon, but can't fault the customer service.

"I didn't believe it, but planned obsolescence.","I didn't believe it, and I wish I had the proof, but I truly feel that most of the comments on Trustpilot are accurate. until May 16-17, my ring was working perfectly. A battery charge lasted for 4-5 days, as it had been for the two years I have owned it. But after a couple of firmware updates and App updates, my ring doesn't even last one night, and that's the most important feature.I LOVED my ring. I had ZERO complaints. Hell, I even recommended it to all my friends that buy this over an Apple Watch. But now I will much rather spend my money buying something else now. I genuinely do not believe battery health drops right off the cliff like it did with my ring. We have all experienced battery issues, be with with our phones, or laptops; they degrade consistently over time. This literally dropped off, perfectly normal operation, didn't notice ANY battery issues at all.The first thing I do after waking up is to sync the ring. On the 17th May, the app couldn't find the ring. I thought, thats strange, it never happens, and I charged it just yesterday as I always do if I do the dishes. It was only until I searched, ""Oura Ring Battery suddenly.."" that Google autocompleted it straight to Trustpilot reviews. Disheartening.Lithium ion battery should last about 500 charge/discharge cycles. With a 4 day (full to zero) battery, the ring should last at least 5.5 years, and even longer if you know how to maintain batteries better.And SURELY it won't happen over night. Unless there is an issue with the firmware and a fix is coming to restore the battery life it accurately has, I am convinced this is planned obsolescence.","1","2021-05-22T12:11:20.000Z","Rohan","GB","7.0"

"Disappointing customer service","I wish I could give this company a better review. The first time around was a great experience and I loved the ring itself, but having to deal with a replacement size has been a nightmare.I requested a size exchange in early April and mailed my original ring back on April 13. They shipped out a replacement ring immediately. This package then got lost via USPS, and their response time was a bit slow when I brought it to their attention - I emailed a few times asking them to check on it starting 4/22, they asked me to wait 1 more week to see if it turns up, which was fine. Then emailed again 4/29 and 4/30 with no response for 4 days. Finally they offered to send a replacement, this time via UPS, which was allegedly mailed out 5/3 with an anticipated arrival on 5/5. The package has been stuck at the ""label created/UPS awaiting package"" stage since then. I emailed again on 5/6 to ask if it had been sent out, and they said they would check with the carrier and get back to me. No updated provided. Emailed them again on 5/7, and again today. Still no response.Truly disappointed as I really loved the product and I've been dying to get it back. It's been a month now since initially attempting the return. The lack of communication and updates is extremely frustrating. At least some response indicating that they are working on the issue would make this a bit more bearable.","2","2021-05-10T19:50:05.000Z","Gabrielle Czernik","US","1.0"

"Great Product & Companion App","I’ve had this ring since March of 2019. I’ve liked it from the start. I did have a problem with my first ring. It was under warranty and they sent me a replacement relatively quickly without hassle. It came from Europe I believe, so it did take a little bit. I wasn’t worried about it though as my expectations were set. Since then I have not had any problems with my ring. I love the data insights it provides me and the fact that I only need to wear the ring to get the data. Since it has been a couple years I do wonder how much longer this particular ring will last. Unless Oura offers some type of significant trade in replacement discount, I’m not sure I can justify the additional expense for a new one when the time comes.","5","2021-05-03T17:18:18.000Z","Keith G","US","7.0"
"Great product, reliable service!","Both me and my wife are one of the early adopters of Oura, we purchased our rings back when you had to wait a few months to have it shipped ;-).Since then we gifted Oura to a few friends, and always the process was smooth and reliable.In particular, after the first year my own ring stopped charging properly and all it took was 1 email with information to have the company send me a replacement; the same happened to one of my friends, and she also had the replacement shipped quickly.In addition, something that I don't think is obvious, the company keeps improving the app – getting better at understanding the sleep data – without any pressure to have you upgrade to a new version, or purchase anything additionally.It is entirely possible that some Silicon Valley fund could have pushed a similar company to start a subscription service or release a new model each year to keep the revenue up, but in the case of Oura, the company displays commendable integrity.My only wish would be to actually get some updated models for the rings where they would collaborate with the Nordic designers for a few limited editions – there are so many classic Finnish designs (e.g. Tapio Wirkkala). As a happy user who used the ring for a few years, I'm both happy to give Oura a bit more money and eager to get some updated look for my ring.","5","2021-04-29T11:54:44.000Z","Monsieur Sergei Klimov","LT","7.0"

They are aware of this (just look at all of the complaints about this specific situation that ours claims to have taken into account) yet still have done nothing to compensate customers or fix this.

It can't connect at all and their only solution was ""download the app fresh every single time you want to open it"". Pathetic.You also need to have the ring on the charger to then re-pair it. Every charge cycle, however short, reduces the battery lifecycle. So you end up needing a new product 10x faster.

Import costs are clear in my opinion and this is not an Oura ring issue but a HM Customs charge.  You can refuse to pay them and the ring gets sent back, apparently.  I have read all the negative reviews and wanted to add some balance here - the insight the ring gives you is superb and I love mine - so much so, I bought one for my good lady who also loves it.","5","2021-04-05T09:22:27.000Z","Mark Alderson","GB","24.0"

"Save your money and buy something better","I purchased my Oura ring just over 2 years ago now. It has been replaced three times in that period. Each time the ring battery fades and it does not last longer than 24 hours (even though they state that it lasts for 7 days). A few days ago my third ring battery was not working and I asked for another replacement to which they responded my ring was out of warranty... that would have been fine had I not had the same problem three times, each time the ring not lasting longer than 6 months. Save your money and buy a WHOOP.","1","2021-03-29T22:49:52.000Z","Scott Ellice-Flint","AU","1.0"

"UK Buyers Beware","I live in the UK. I have had a £67 import tax bill from DHL to be paid before delivery of the Oura ring. At the point of order on their website, the cart price was in Dollars, so it wasn't clear that it was being delivered from the Netherlands. At checkout it was $0.0 for additional payments, so I placed the order. It was certainly not made clear that import taxes would be due. I wish I had seen these Trustpilot comments before ordering. I sent a pre-purchase enquiry to Oura Sales last Saturday and received a response almost immediately. Now that I am querying the additional charges, they have gone quiet. After sales seems to be a very different experience with this company.I was looking forward to using the ring, but I feel that I have been mislead to the point that I now simply want my order cancelled and the money refunded. I now have a very different view about the company and unfortunately their product too. Really disappointing.","1","2021-03-28T10:41:17.000Z","John","GB","2.0"
"Bad AURA around OURA","UPDATE:  Oh Wow, thanks Oura!!   I'm certain sharing the link to this review with your customer support team may have had something to do with your expedited reply?  You might think if you're support team had the time to reply to a negative review, they could take a moment to contact the customer and remedy the situation immediately.   instead, i receive ANOTHER GENERIC RESPONSE  ""We will  get back to you in 5 business days""  Your latest email says!  ""30 DAY NO HASSLE RETURN OR EXCHANGE""  lol-----------------------------Where to begin.   Interesting idea.   Bad implementation.   ABYSMAL customer service. One week old OURA ring.   BRICKED after firmware update.    No contact or phone support.   After 3 days of back and forth emails with generic unpersonalized email ""un-tech support"" they confirmed ring is defective and want me to wait 5 days for warranty dept to review to see if eligible ??   IT""S A WEEK OLD!!!A reputable company would have had a customer service person remedy the situation and replace a 7 day old defective ring.  NOT OURA!Good luck trying to find someone to honor the ""30 DAY NO HASSLE REFUND or Exchange"" Policy. LOL!!l"".   They go silent when you mention ""return."" and no one to contact or reply after submitting request to refund. I'm submitting complaints to BBB and fortunately American Express will reimburse and deal with OURA. OURA is not a well run company.   The product is not ready for primetime.   It's basically a $400 waste of time and frustration with no way to resolve or get in touch with anyone.

"Be careful. No refund, no reply after 3 weeks","Well, there seems to be a pattern with poor after sales support.First for the product: The movement data eg. steps counting is totally useless for me, multiple rather lazy home office days and the ring had around 14k steps per day. I work in tech and i get that the tracking is an approximation but this was totally off. Also the biggest ring size was uncomforable during nights. But that is subjective of course.As for the support, i told them about my problems and asked to return the ring, after some back and forth i got my RMA number and sent the Ring back with the original packaging via DHL. It was delivered almost 3 weeks ago and i still have no money and no reply to my messages.As for now i would advice to stay away from oura until they sort out their customer support.UPDATE: The refund has been taken care of after posting here rather quickly.","1","2021-03-15T13:14:25.000Z","philipp wintermantel","DE","1.0"
"Faulty new ring and Oura ghosting - Don't buy","Wish I'd seen these reviews before I bought the ring.  I was shocked by an added £74 tax bill which took the ring well over what already seemed a pricey sum, which now make the Apple Watch look more interesting. Never a good idea to make a competitor look good. The ring was very difficult to connect to my Iphone.  Four days in it started to have faults.  Today is 8 days in and I'm told by Oura that it is faulty (at least I didn't have to tell them that) and they want my details to pass on to the warranty department (which sounds like a stall).  Feeling very glum having read the other reviews.  I feel taken for a ride and it looks like I may struggle to get a remotely reasonable resolution in a reasonable period of time. Very ironic as the ring is about improving sleep and all this is doing is adding stress to my life. So now it's a five day wait for a warranty person to  check the warranty. Watch this space - I'll let you know if this is resolved well and quickly - before you spend nearly £400 on trying to improve your sleep. So 10 days since Oura told me they would check my warranty and I've heard no more, no response to reminder emails.  While I had been willing to have a replacement this now comes across as a scam - the company and product are not what is suggested by their PR machine.","1","2021-03-18T11:49:21.000Z","penny vera-sanso","GB","21.0"

Oura owe me that, so should refund me the missing £21.20. I was told I would have to pay for the shipping - why? It was their faulty ring. Out of principal I will continue to insist to get this back 31-03-21 UPDATEOura persist in ignoring my emails and have no process for telephoning them.

They ‘forgot’ to send me the correct reference numbers for the pick up. They use UPS for shipments and pick up, and they are totally inefficient outside of the USOura are a new company who have a LOT to learn about customer service.

"Excellent product","I have been using the Oura ring since March 2020. I have to say that in monitoring my night resting heart rate, sleep and activities this ring is better than the Fitbit and Apple Watch that I have. I truly prefer Oura and their way of analyzing my data. The ring stopped working in December and it took one month for the customer service to send me a new ring after I sent more than 10 emails. So 5 starts for the ring, customer service needs to improve as it’s letting down a really good product. I would probably want to see heart rate monitoring during the day being added and daily heart rate analyze to make this even better than Fitbit and Apple apps together. Thank you Scout from customer service for finally sorting my issue and sending me the new ring which I’m now using and very happy with.

"Stuck with a ring too small...","My daughter ordered the ring as a gift. It was too big (size 9). We used their sizing recommendations (size 7). The replacement was too small. When we tried to return it they told us only one return. Never programmed and in the case of the size 7, never even on my finger. I would be happy to pay postage to return it. Never given an option. Just a terse email saying no more returns. Now, I guess we have to sell this one on Ebay. And, the response time for communications with them can be LONG.

"The answer of a 15 days old ring......after review a solution","The answer of a 15 days old ring......Thanks for reaching out to us about your scratched ring.Each Oura Ring’s shell is made of titanium and is coated with a diamond-like carbon(DLC) or physical vapor deposition(PVD) finish depending on the ring color, for improved scratch resistance.• Titanium with PVD coating in silver and gold-colored rings.• Titanium with DLC coating in all other models.Despite this, certain activities may result in scratches to your ring's exterior. Here are a few best practices to avoid scratching or damaging your ring's exterior:• Wear the ring on your non-dominant hand to reduce the amount of potential contact with various surfaces (this can also help with receiving more accurate activity data).• Avoid wearing other rings below, on top, and next to your Oura ring.• Remove your Oura ring in situations that may result in excess friction (i.e. weightlifting), or when handling other objects made of metal or stone.Unfortunately, physical damage, like scratches, are not covered under our warranty. Therefore, a replacement is not an option under our current policy. You can find our Terms of Use (Warranty Information) here.We understand situations like this are frustrating. Please let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.In good health,Viena | Oura SupportI send a reply mail, but no answer........ on my replyDear Employee,This is not a very pleasant answer. The ring has only been worn for 15 days and is now ready for it. My mother does not do any physical work, so there are not many chances of damage. I expect better quality for a ring of 400 euros. I would like a solution.It is not a solution to refer us to the warranty policy. I had already read that myself before the purchase. Every ring that you can buy at oura clearly states that it is scratch resistant. If a ring is damaged in such a short time, it is not scratch resistant. If you agree, your text on the website is very mislead.If no solution can be found, I would like to return the ring and we will cancel the purchase because the product does not meet our expectations.To be on the safe side, take the photo of the ring. So it should be black!I would like to hear what is still possible.Your request (633184)after posting the review, oura contacted anyway and provided a good solution. communication could be better masr the solution is ultimately good.","3","2021-02-19T18:59:48.000Z","Ruben de Kleine","NL","1.0"

"£70 Customs Tax Surprise - UK","I purchased an Oura ring from their website last week. I am from the UK and have been hit with a huge £70 customs tax bill this morning. After Googling the issue it seems it is very common for people to be surprised by this bill as the company fails to make this clear at the point of purchase. It seems they explain the buyer is responsible for customs tax in their T's and C's but they could so easily be up front and honest about this when you select your country on the website.Instead they don't see this as their problem, and are happy to have buyers surprised with this bill.Oura; all I can do is leave you a bad review here as I am very dissatisfied with the purchase experience so far.

It took them two weeks to respond to my initial request to return it (which judging by some of the reviews on here was actually quite fast for them) so having received the information I sent it all off, only to find that after 3 weeks, it has been sitting in a UPS warehouse because they haven't provided UPS with the right information!! And now UPS are returning the ring to me!!!! The utter incompetence of these people is staggering.  And they haven't responded to any of my follow up emails after the last two weeks asking why they haven't given UPS the information...It really isn't worth buying anything from these guys, because if there are any problems they won't do squat, and you're £300 out of pocket.  Another dodgy vendor that's going to have to be made to pay up in court.Edit: Why is it you can respond to bad reviews the same day, but it takes two weeks to get a reply to refund request, and even then you can't actually make the effort, despite having 3 weeks to do so, to get the item returned?","1","2021-02-05T17:00:18.000Z","Alex","GB","21.0"

"SICK OF REVIEWS ABOUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE ACTUAL PRODUCT?! READ ON..","Leaving one star because you're angry with people is ridiculous...I know its frustrating, but people need a review of the product not just the service!!!The ring itself is a fantastic investment! It's so accurate and has prompted me to work harder in my work outs (by showing me data about my daily activity score and readiness) and have earlier nights due to its notifications and advice. I could no longer use the Fitbit/apple watches as I have tattoos on both wrists...new technology does not allow the leds to penetrate through tattoo pigment- awful design flaw they will not tell you! So I luckily I have 3 untattooed fingers and found this amazing device! The information is detailed and gives you explanations as to what your scores mean and how you should conduct yourself for the day based on sleep data and how active you have been and are in general. I love that it has access to meditation and relaxing apps as well and prompts to get you moving if you've been sat chilling for just a bit too long.I received this as a gift for Christmas, I got the actual ring the first week of January after trying out the sizes, so have had enough time using it. Ordering the ring after paying was a bit strange, as I was given a weird number to call and it didnt seem legit, but reading through the comments they are a relatively new company and still working out the kinks (this has nothing to do with the quality of the ring itself). I'm going to throw it out there too, we are in pandemic guys!If you're looking for a way to track your health and keep you motivated, this is the product you need. Its lightweight, fairly decent to look at and I forget it's on! I'm a barista so constantly washing hands and using them, ring is going fine! Battery life is also fine, just make sure you charge it...the app lets you know when its low. All in all, great product and will definitely be sticking with it :-)","5","2021-02-03T09:07:22.000Z","Sarah","GB","12.0"
"Dodgy battery life","Bought the ring, massive investment for me but thought it would be quality with a two year warranty. Loved it so much at the beginning, until I started missing nights of sleep data because the battery was dying. Turns out they're just happy to replace defunct rings until your warranty expires.. my first lasted a little over a year before the battery went, took ages to get the second, it finally arrived and lasted about 5 months before the battery was twice as bad as the original one. However, it had just clocked over the 2 year warranty, so the only compensation offered was the stock standard ""save $50 to upgrade"".. as if I'd be up for round three of battery fails on an expensive product. I'm now left with a ring that needs to sit on its dock to charge every day, and is degrading at a rate that in about a month it probably won't even last the night on a full battery. Hugely disappointed.","1","2021-02-03T07:18:37.000Z","Mel Binks","AU","1.0"

"Worthless return policy and appalling customer service","If you are going to buy an Oura ring, please be very sure that you want it as the return procedure is not very straight forward and to be honest, thus far for me, worthless. And the support for it is terrible.The customer service was great before I bought the ring. When I went to return it though, it took them about a week to get back to me. I’ve gone back to them with a question and it has been radio silence - absolutely no one has answered my question despite following up twice. The window for the return is running out. This is just not acceptable.The process for returning the ring from Australia is near to impossible. I have been advised by UPS that to return it and charge Oura like Oura have asked me to, I actually need to setup a business account with them which involves, ID, credit checks and a lengthy approval process. UPS have advised that it is possible for Oura to generate a return label and email it to me. I have asked Oura via email for a return label and heard absolutely nothing back. If they are not planning to honour the 30 day return then why are they offering it in the first place?","1","2021-01-24T05:22:38.000Z","Nick Condon","AU","3.0"

Well, 12 days later, and numerous other support tickets and messages I have sent, I still haven't got even a single reply (in fact, some of the newer support tickets were just closed so I know someone at least saw them). It also doesn't help that my ability to file tickets in the app has now been removed. I have had my ring for just over a year, so it should be covered, but at the rate things are going, I doubt I will ever hear from the warranty team.

Bluetooth pairing is good and the battery currently lasts 1wk between charges. Looks good and very comfortable to wear. My feeling is apart from body temp and heart rate variability the sleep and fitness data is perhaps not as accurate as other specific apps, but the oura ring offers an all round package. It won’t necessarily improve your health but it’ll certainly make you more health aware. It’s expensive but I like it, and as long as you understand it’s limitations I’d recommend it.","4","2020-10-03T08:24:12.000Z","Daniel","GB","2.0"

Really pleased with the outcome.I was looking forward to receiving the ring, when it arrived I read the instructions charged it and paired with my iPhone.  Placed ring on finger all was well.  Monitored all the right things great, monitored sleep all was well then at 8:15 am just stopped working wouldn’t monitor steps or anything?  Looked online followed all suggestions deleted  app, re paired ring with phone endless frustration with no result tried charging again one minute 70% next 61% then notification fully charged but actually not.

"confirmation of purchase","I had to order the ring twice because Oura stated my order never went thru. Both orders cleared my credit card company and I had to get a refund for the first order.  I received the ring sizing kit, so something went thru, but when I went to finish the order and request the ring I was told again no order existed. Customer service is only email so it has been days of turn around time for any communication. I am not passing final judgment because I am still in the protracted process and might actually get a product at some point, but this process in a time when I can order a motorcycle from Italy (actual thing) is a definite deficit with Oura.","2","2020-09-21T13:26:17.000Z","jim & tish sisamis","US","1.0"
"Amazing Sleep Tracking technology","Amazing Sleep Tracking technology!  I used to have the Basis sleep tracker watch before it got pulled from the market because some people had gotten skin burns from the high level temperature tracking it did, which was a real bummer, considering it really worked to track deep sleep and REM not, just the amount of sleep.  Thankfully, Ouraring is able to also measure skin temp. and use the same type of formulation to really track your deep sleep very accurately and with an easier to sleep with device.  I don't even use it for cardio fitness tracking, since my apple phone and watch can do that just fine.   I have had no glitches and it works more reliably than any other technology I have used recently.  I have submerged it in water many times with no isssues. Also, I had no problems with the shipment or order timeframe.","5","2020-09-15T07:33:26.000Z","Rick Swartzburg","US","1.0"
"Before you get this ring...","Before you get this ring, consider the following: Oura recommends that you ""upsize"" when purchasing. The ring is very chunky (aesthetically not bad) but as fingers may swell during the night or contract outside during the winter months, the ring becomes something to constantly think about: ""Either did I lose it or how on earth will i get it off?"" It doesn't track much info during the day, has no sleep-synced alarm (shout out to the Sleep cycle app- my best subscription), and just becomes a ""is this $300 still on my finger"" hazard. Try not to loose it. And good luck finding it if your Bluetooth actually connects to the ring or if your ring battery has died.

"Defective ring, Oura won’t replace","My ring doesn’t function correctly. It consistently over-reports activity by at least 900%. When I reached out to Oura, they told me that I was mistaken and actually DO move that much. I am a severely disabled person and am familiar enough with my illness to know that I am NOT reaching those activity levels by laying flat on my back and texting. Then they told me I must have some kind of “vibration” near my hands all day. These scenarios are ludicrous. Either Oura is useless as an activity tracker, or I have a defective ring. Regardless, this is one of the worst product experiences I’ve ever had. If it can’t even get simple activity tracking right, is any of the data correct? I’ll be sure to alert others to the shoddy product as often as possible.I contacted Oura after they responded below. The result? They responded right away saying I’d have my replacement in three weeks. And three weeks after their promise, they emailed saying they weren’t going to replace it.Bottom line?

"Too many issues to recommend","First, I want to start off by saying that I love what they are attempting to do here with this ring and I love this product when it works. The issue unfortunately is that the battery seems to work great for 7 months (6-7 days per charge) and then goes off a cliff and needs to be charged daily. I have had this happen to two rings at almost 7 months to the day. The first one was replaced via warranty with very little trouble. My latest one unfortunately has taken weeks and DHL has either lost the package or delivered it to the wrong address and Oura is not responding to my emails. There is also no way to get in touch with them by phone. My ring will also not charge past 1 percent at this point so its essentially dead. This is not acceptable for a product that costs much more than its competitors. I want to recommend this product as I would love for them to fix this ring however, the clear hardware issues coupled with the lack of response and the fact that this is a company that’s just not set up to do business in the U.S. makes it impossible to recommend for 300-400 dollars.

At the end of the ordeal, the second rep apologised for the poor service but didn't mention any steps they would take to improve transparency and stop messing customers around in the future so it feels hollow.I regret buying my ring and feel completely mugged off by the support process.

I have been in contact with oura for months and they’ve said they are working on getting it fixed but being very slow/ won’t give me a time frame of when this is going to happen.","2","2019-09-30T12:35:49.000Z","Courtney","US","1.0"
"My phone does not recognize my ring…","My phone does not recognize my ring through bluetooth, it recognizes other devices. I had email replies telling me to do this and reset that etc, and to no avail, now not replying to me, I would avoid this ring and company. Very Frustrating to have an expensive ring that wont connect to my phone, and no conclusive support. I will email you again OURA about this issue!!!","1","2019-09-25T09:02:04.000Z","Customer","NL","7.0"
"pOOR CUSTOMER SERVICE","YOU CAN ONLY RATE A PRODUCT WHEN YOU RECIEVE IT. THERE WAS A POSTAL ISSUE AND USPS SENT IT BACK TO OURA ON 1ST AUG. I HAVE BEEN ON EMAILS BACK AND FORTH SINCE THEN AND KEEP GETTING DIFFERENT REPLIES. NO STRAIGHT ANSWER ON RESENDING IT OR REFUND. DO NOT BUY BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE GOD FORBID YOU WILL BE STUCK LIKE I AM.","1","2019-08-27T13:44:24.000Z","Bhavna Chopra","IN","1.0"
"Great app, but highly inaccurate data and very bad customer service","Positive+ I love the app: great, intuitive interface with a lot of interesting data+ Ring design: I like the look, and it is comfortable to wear 24/7+ Good battery lifeNegative- I was very disappointed when I realised, after using the ring for 5 weeks, that the recorded data is very inaccurate:-- It thinks I sleep when I watch TV in the evening-- It has established that my base calorie burn without exercise is 1600kcal - I loose weight pretty rapidly with that amount of daily calories (i.e. even without exercise when the total calorie consumption is obviously higher)-- Its walking equivalency is even 50% off. For a bit less than a 5km walk it gives 10km. The number of steps is equally inaccurate.- It is supposed to capture ""restful moments"" during the day, but even if I take a 45min nap (and sleep properly), it doesn't get recorded- Beware that if you do exercise such that your hands are stable (e.g. using an exercise bike), it doesn't get recorded. This is by design. You can add activities manually, though.- Customer service is almost non-existent. They don't seem to have a contact number and if they answer your email, it takes several weeks.Having said all that, after 5 weeks I'm still using the product. I like watching the graphs and result even though I know they are way off. I guess I'm hoping that they are systematically off, so that I would see a difference to better or worse ...","2","2019-08-21T19:18:51.000Z","Nana","GB","2.0"
"Shell company behaviour with no response","After trying the ring daily and nightly for about a month, I decided to return the ring as I believe the data it record (more the interpretation of it) does not make sense and seems misleading. I initiated a refund through their channels but, similar to other customers, have only had a negative customer experience so far by waiting for their reply. Still after one week and three emails later, no comment was offered by the company although the customer depends on a specific return number which needs to be issued by the company first. Oura - you guys really need to up your game on customer service otherwise your future will not be a happy ending...","1","2019-07-14T16:44:04.000Z","Marcus","GB","2.0"
"I'd love to review the ring","I'd love to review the ring, but I can't seem to get one shipped to me.  I placed my order 7 weeks ago, with a 4-6 week shipping time.  After about 3 weeks, the ship date slipped first by 1 week, then by 2, and now my original ship date of 6/14 has moved to 7/19, a total of 5 additional weeks.  Customer support took more than a week to reply to my question about the slip and I was given some 'batches' hand-waving (apparently they do not keep _any_ stock).  I was charged at the time of ordering which, contrary to Oura's claims, is not standard e-commerce practice (at least not in the USA).Furthermore, their shipping update page clearly states at the top that they update every week, but it really is more like every 2 weeks.  Asking about that got me a boilerplate reply about how busy they are, again with a long delay before answering.Reviews from people who actually have the ring seem good, but I can't confirm them.  What I can do is review their customer service, which is some of the worst I have seen over the past 10 years.UPDATE:  I have decided to cancel my order.  Will update when they refund my money.","1","2019-06-22T23:22:31.000Z","Jim Mulder","US","1.0"
"I have just unwrapped my new ring","I have just unwrapped my new ring, it's a silver one or what I thought should be silver from the website it look nice, this looks like tin foil, looks very cheap chrome ring that you would get out of a kids toy vending machine. I am not impressed. not even sure if it will work yet because I'm charging it up but I probably will end up not wearing it because it looks crap.time for me to return it I have to pay the postage and packaging even though they falsely advertised the way it would look on their website.","1","2019-06-17T17:30:30.000Z","David Angell-Williams","GB","17.0"
"My ring was sent defective and getting a replacement impossible","My ring was sent defective. The instructions to send it back on the oura UPS account were wrong and took two weeks and two trips to UPS to send back in. They won't send a new ring even though the data they had confirmed my ring didn't work until you have a tracking number from ups. I did that and was informed they had their system down to improve the buying experience for new buyers and that warranty issues were running behind. When I complained, via email, which is the only option,  they said I misunderstood their message and ups misunderstood the initial instructions. I asked for them to cancel the ring and provide a refund.","1","2019-06-10T11:25:56.000Z","Maudet","US","1.0"
"Really good product","Really good product if you want to deep dive into your sleep. I am using it since more than 2 weeks now and I am really happy with.It can be expensive yes but you can easily find some discount code on internet to make it cheaper !","5","2019-04-01T10:59:22.000Z","Yann","IE","3.0"
"Sadly the saga goes on","Sadly the saga goes on. The ring did not fit remotely despite having paid an additional EU 15 for the sizing kit. They accept returns but you not only have to pay for postage (although their sizing kit is faulty) but they estimate an additional time to process and send (after they have received it) of 10 days. Oura - you need to start thinking about the customers experience and needs and not your own. Businesses offer free returns for far cheaper items.","1","2019-02-28T13:04:52.000Z","Blossom","PL","42.0"
"I bought a ring from Oura","I bought a ring from Oura, than less than a month later I decided to return it because I wasn't impressed with it. 2 Months later I still have not been refunded my money. I have sent them numerous emails and rarely ever do I get any response. I think that if I just forgot about it they would never send me my money!","1","2019-01-13T16:20:54.000Z","Josh Lorentz","US","4.0"
